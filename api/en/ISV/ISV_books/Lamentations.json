      "1": "How lonely she lies, the city that thronged with people! Like a widow she has become, this great one among nations! The princess among provinces has become a vassal.",
      "2": "Bitterly she cries in the night, as tears stream down her cheeks. No one consoles her of all her friends. All her neighbors have betrayed her; they have become her enemies.",
      "3": "Judah has gone into exile to escape affliction and servitude. She that sat among the nations, has found no rest. All her pursuers overtook her amid narrow passes.",
      "4": "The roads that lead to Zion are in mourning, because no one travels to the festivals. All her gates are desolate; her priests are moaning. Her young women are grieving, and she is bitter.",
      "5": "Her adversaries dominate her, her enemies prosper. For the Lord has made her suffer because of her many transgressions. Her children have gone away, taken into captivity in the presence of the enemy.",
      "6": "Fled from cherished Zion are all that were her splendor. Her princes have become like deer that cannot find their feeding grounds. They flee with strength exhausted from their pursuers.",
      "7": "Jerusalem remembers her time of affliction and misery; all her valued belongings of days gone by, when her people fell into enemy hands, with no one to help her, and her enemies stared at her, mocking her downfall.",
      "8": "Jerusalem sinned greatly, and she became unclean. All who honored her now despise her, because they saw her naked. She herself groans and turns her face away.",
      "9": "Uncleanness has soiled her skirts, and she gave no thought to what would follow. She fell in such a startling way, with no one to comfort her. Look, Lord, upon my affliction, because my enemy is boasting.",
      "10": "The adversary seized in his hands everything she valued. She watched the nations enter her sanctuary; those you forbade to enter your place of meeting.",
      "11": "All her people groaned as they searched for food. They traded their valuables in order to eat, to keep themselves alive. Look, Lord, and see how I have become dishonored.",
      "12": "May it not befall you, all who pass along the road! Look and see: Is there any grief like my grief dealt out to me, by which the Lord afflicted me in the time of his fierce wrath?",
      "13": "He sent fire from on high, making it penetrate my bones. He stretched out a net at my feet, forcing me to turn back. He made me desolate; I’m fainting all day long.",
      "14": "The yoke of my sins was bound on, fastened together by his hand. They settled on my neck; he caused my strength to fail. The Lord placed me in the power of those I cannot resist.",
      "15": "He rejected all the valiant men— the Lord, in my midst. He set a time to meet with me to crush my young warriors. The Lord has trampled, as in a winepress, the fair virgin that is Judah.",
      "16": "Because of all this, I weep; my eyes stream with tears because far from me is the comforter of my soul. My children are sorrowful, because the enemy has won.",
      "17": "Zion spreads out her hands; no one is there to comfort her. The Lord has issued an order against Jacob, that all who are around him are to be his enemies; Jerusalem has become unclean among them.",

      "19": "I called out to my lovers, but they deceived me. My priests and my elders have died within the city while looking for something to eat to keep themselves alive.",
      "20": "Look, Lord, how distressed I am; all my insides are churning. My heart is troubled within me, because I vigorously rebelled. Outside the sword brings loss of life, while at home death rules.",
      "21": "People heard how I groan, with no one to comfort me. All my adversaries have heard about my troubles; they rejoice that you have caused them. Bring on the day you have promised, so my adversaries will become like me.",
      "22": "May all of their wickedness come to your attention, and deal with them as you have done with me because of all my transgressions. For I am constantly groaning, and my heart is faint."

      "3": "In his fierce wrath he cut off all the strength of Israel. He withdrew his protection as the enemy approached. He burned Jacob like a blazing fire consumes everything around it.",
      "4": "He bent his bow against us as would an enemy, his right hand cocked as would an adversary. He has killed everyone in whom we took pride; in the tent of cherished Zion he poured out his anger like fire.",

      "10": "The leaders of cherished Zion sit silently on the ground; they throw dust on their heads and dress in mourning clothes. The young women of Jerusalem bow their heads in sorrow.",
      "11": "My eyes are worn out from crying, my insides are churning, My emotions pour out in grief because my people are destroyed— Children and infants faint in the streets of the city.",
      "12": "They ask their mothers, “Is there anything to eat or drink?” They faint in the streets of the city like wounded men. Their life ebbs away while they lie on their mother’s bosom.",
      "13": "What can be said about you? To what should you be compared, fair Jerusalem? To what may I liken you, so I may comfort you, fair one of Zion? Indeed, your wound is as deep as the sea— who can heal you?",
      "14": "Your prophets look on your behalf; they see false and deceptive visions. They did not expose your sins in order to restore what had been captured. Instead, they crafted oracles for you that are false and misleading.",
      "15": "Everyone who passes by on the road shake their fists at you. They hiss and shake their heads at cherished Jerusalem: “Is this the city men used to call ‘The Perfection of Beauty,’ and ‘The Joy of the Entire Earth’”?",
      "16": "All of your enemies insult you with gaping mouths. They hiss and grind their teeth while saying, “We have devoured her completely. Yes, this is the day that we anticipated! We found it at last; we have seen it!”",
      "17": "The Lord did what he planned. He carried out his threat. Just as he commanded long ago, he has torn down without pity; He let the enemy boast about you and has exalted the power of your enemies.",
      "18": "Cry out from your heart to the Lord, wall of fair Zion! Let your tears run down like a river day and night. Allow yourself no rest, and don’t stop crying.",
      "19": "Get up and cry aloud in the night, at the beginning of every hour. Pour out your heart like water in the presence of the Lord! Lift up your hands toward him for the lives of your children, who are fainting away at every street corner.",
      "20": "Look, Lord, and take note: To whom have you done this? Should women eat their offspring, the children they have cuddled? Should priests and prophets be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?",
      "21": "Young men and the aged lie on the ground in the streets; my young women and young men have fallen by the sword. You killed them in your anger, slaughtering them without pity.",
      "22": "You have invited those who terrorize me to come around, as if today were a festival. No one has escaped or survived the time of the Lord’s anger. My enemy has finished off those whom I cuddled and raised."
