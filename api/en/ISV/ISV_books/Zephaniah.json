      "9": "Therefore as I’m alive and living,” declares the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel, “Moab will surely become like Sodom, and the Ammonites like Gomorrah, a place overrun by weeds and salty marshes, unpopulated forever. The survivors of my people will confiscate their property, and those who remain of my nation will inherit what was theirs.",
      "10": "This they will have in lieu of their pride, because they have insulted and mocked the people of the Lord of the Heavenly Armies.",
