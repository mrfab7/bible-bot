      "6": "Don’t stare at me because I’m dark; the sun has tanned me. My mother’s sons were angry with me. They made me the caretaker of the vineyards, but I didn’t take care of my own vineyard.",

      "14": "My dove, in the hidden places of the rocks, in the secret places of the cliffs, show me your form, and let me hear your voice. For your voice is pleasant, and your shape is lovely.",
      "15": "Catch the foxes for us, the little foxes that destroy the vineyards, our vineyards that are in bloom.”",
      "16": "My beloved belongs to me and I belong to him. He is the one who shepherds his flock among the lilies.",
