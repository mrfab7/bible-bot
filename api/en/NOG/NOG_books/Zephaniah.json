      "7": "The coast will belong to the faithful few from the nation of Judah. There they will graze their sheep. In the evening they will lie down in the houses of Ashkelon. Yahweh their Elohim will take care of them and will restore their fortunes.",

The faithful few of my people will loot them, and those who are left in my nation will take possession of them.”",
