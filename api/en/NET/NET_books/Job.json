  "Job": {
    "1": {
      "1": "There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job. And that man was blameless and upright, one who feared God and turned away from evil.",
      "2": "Seven sons and three daughters were born to him.",
      "3": "His possessions included 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, and 500 female donkeys; in addition he had a very great household. Thus he was the greatest of all the people in the east.",
      "4": "Now his sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each one in turn, and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.",
      "5": "When the days of their feasting were finished, Job would send for them and sanctify them; he would get up early in the morning and offer burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job thought, “Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.” This was Job’s customary practice.",
      "6": "Now the day came when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord—and Satan also arrived among them.",
      "7": "The Lord said to Satan, “Where have you come from?” And Satan answered the Lord, “From roving about on the earth, and from walking back and forth across it.”",
      "8": "So the Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and turns away from evil.”",
      "9": "Then Satan answered the Lord, “Is it for nothing that Job fears God?",
      "10": "Have you not made a hedge around him and his household and all that he has on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his livestock have increased in the land.",
      "11": "But extend your hand and strike everything he has, and he will no doubt curse you to your face!”",
      "12": "So the Lord said to Satan, “All right then, everything he has is in your power. Only do not extend your hand against the man himself!” So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord.",
      "13": "Now the day came when Job’s sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house,",
      "14": "and a messenger came to Job, saying, “The oxen were plowing and the donkeys were grazing beside them,",
      "15": "and the Sabeans swooped down and carried them all away, and they killed the servants with the sword! And I—only I alone—escaped to tell you!”",
      "16": "While this one was still speaking, another messenger arrived and said, “The fire of God has fallen from heaven and has burned up the sheep and the servants—it has consumed them! And I—only I alone—escaped to tell you!”",
      "17": "While this one was still speaking another messenger arrived and said, “The Chaldeans formed three bands and made a raid on the camels and carried them all away, and they killed the servants with the sword! And I—only I alone—escaped to tell you!”",
      "18": "While this one was still speaking another messenger arrived and said, “Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house,",
      "19": "and suddenly a great wind swept across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young people, and they died! And I—only I alone—escaped to tell you!”",
      "20": "Then Job got up and tore his robe. He shaved his head, and then he threw himself down with his face to the ground.",
      "21": "He said, “Naked I came from my mother’s womb, and naked I will return there. The Lord gives, and the Lord takes away. May the name of the Lord be blessed!”",
      "22": "In all this Job did not sin, nor did he charge God with moral impropriety."
    },
    "2": {
      "1": "Again the day came when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also arrived among them to present himself before the Lord.",
      "2": "And the Lord said to Satan, “Where have you come from?” Satan answered the Lord, “From roving about on the earth, and from walking back and forth across it.”",
      "3": "Then the Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? For there is no one like him on the earth, a pure and upright man, one who fears God and turns away from evil. And he still holds firmly to his integrity, so that you stirred me up to destroy him without reason.”",
      "4": "But Satan answered the Lord, “Skin for skin! Indeed, a man will give up all that he has to save his life.",
      "5": "But extend your hand and strike his bone and his flesh, and he will no doubt curse you to your face!”",
      "6": "So the Lord said to Satan, “All right, he is in your power; only preserve his life.”",
      "7": "So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord, and he afflicted Job with a malignant ulcer from the soles of his feet to the top of his head.",
      "8": "Job took a shard of broken pottery to scrape himself with while he was sitting among the ashes.",
      "9": "Then his wife said to him, “Are you still holding firmly to your integrity? Curse God, and die!”",
      "10": "But he replied, “You’re talking like one of the godless women would do! Should we receive what is good from God, and not also receive what is evil?” In all this Job did not sin by what he said.",
      "11": "When Job’s three friends heard about all this calamity that had happened to him, each of them came from his own country—Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. They met together to come to show sympathy for him and to console him.",
      "12": "But when they gazed intently from a distance but did not recognize him, they began to weep loudly. Each of them tore his robes, and they threw dust into the air over their heads.",
      "13": "Then they sat down with him on the ground for seven days and seven nights, yet no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his pain was very great."
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "After this Job opened his mouth and cursed the day he was born.",
      "2": "Job spoke up and said:",
      "3": "“Let the day on which I was born perish, and the night that said, ‘A man has been conceived!’",
      "4": "That day—let it be darkness; let not God on high regard it, nor let light shine on it!",
      "5": "Let darkness and the deepest shadow claim it; let a cloud settle on it; let whatever blackens the day terrify it.",
      "6": "That night—let darkness seize it; let it not be included among the days of the year; let it not enter among the number of the months!",
      "7": "Indeed, let that night be barren; let no shout of joy penetrate it!",
      "8": "Let those who curse the day curse it— those who are prepared to rouse Leviathan.",
      "9": "Let its morning stars be darkened; let it wait for daylight but find none, nor let it see the first rays of dawn,",
      "10": "because it did not shut the doors of my mother’s womb on me, nor did it hide trouble from my eyes.",
      "11": "“Why did I not die at birth, and why did I not expire as I came out of the womb?",
      "12": "Why did the knees welcome me, and why were there two breasts that I might nurse at them?",
      "13": "For now I would be lying down and would be quiet, I would be asleep and then at peace",
      "14": "with kings and counselors of the earth who built for themselves places now desolate,",
      "15": "or with princes who possessed gold, who filled their palaces with silver.",
      "16": "Or why was I not buried like a stillborn infant, like infants who have never seen the light?",
      "17": "There the wicked cease from turmoil, and there the weary are at rest.",
      "18": "There the prisoners relax together; they do not hear the voice of the oppressor.",
      "19": "Small and great are there, and the slave is free from his master.",
      "20": "“Why does God give light to one who is in misery, and life to those whose soul is bitter,",
      "21": "to those who wait for death that does not come, and search for it more than for hidden treasures,",
      "22": "who rejoice even to jubilation, and are exultant when they find the grave?",
      "23": "Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden, and whom God has hedged in?",
      "24": "For my sighing comes in place of my food, and my groanings flow forth like water.",
      "25": "For the very thing I dreaded has happened to me, and what I feared has come upon me.",
      "26": "I have no ease, I have no quietness; I cannot rest; turmoil has come upon me.”"
    },
    "4": {
      "1": "Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered:",
      "2": "“If someone should attempt a word with you, will you be impatient? But who can refrain from speaking?",
      "3": "Look, you have instructed many; you have strengthened feeble hands.",
      "4": "Your words have supported those who stumbled, and you have strengthened the knees that gave way.",
      "5": "But now the same thing comes to you, and you are discouraged; it strikes you, and you are terrified.",
      "6": "Is not your piety your confidence, and your blameless ways your hope?",
      "7": "Call to mind now: Who, being innocent, ever perished? And where were upright people ever destroyed?",
      "8": "Even as I have seen, those who plow iniquity and those who sow trouble reap the same.",
      "9": "By the breath of God they perish, and by the blast of his anger they are consumed.",
      "10": "There is the roaring of the lion and the growling of the young lion, but the teeth of the young lions are broken.",
      "11": "The mighty lion perishes for lack of prey, and the cubs of the lioness are scattered.",
      "12": "“Now a word was stealthily brought to me, and my ear caught a whisper of it.",
      "13": "In the troubling thoughts of the dreams in the night when a deep sleep falls on men,",
      "14": "dread gripped me and trembling, which made all my bones shake.",
      "15": "Then a breath of air passes by my face; it makes the hair of my flesh stand up.",
      "16": "It stands still, but I cannot recognize its appearance; an image is before my eyes, and I hear a murmuring voice:",
      "17": "‘Is a mortal man righteous before God? Or a man pure before his Creator?",
      "18": "If God puts no trust in his servants and attributes folly to his angels,",
      "19": "how much more to those who live in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed like a moth?",
      "20": "They are destroyed between morning and evening; they perish forever without anyone regarding it.",
      "21": "Is not their excess wealth taken away from them? They die, yet without attaining wisdom.’"
    },
    "5": {
      "1": "“Call now! Is there anyone who will answer you? To which of the holy ones will you turn?",
      "2": "For wrath kills the foolish person, and anger slays the silly one.",
      "3": "I myself have seen the fool taking root, but suddenly I cursed his place of residence.",
      "4": "His children are far from safety, and they are crushed at the place where judgment is rendered, nor is there anyone to deliver them.",
      "5": "The hungry eat up his harvest, and take it even from behind the thorns, and the thirsty pant for their wealth.",
      "6": "For evil does not come up from the dust, nor does trouble spring up from the ground,",
      "7": "but people are born to trouble, as surely as the sparks fly upward.",
      "8": "“But as for me, I would seek God, and to God I would set forth my case.",
      "9": "He does great and unsearchable things, marvelous things without number;",
      "10": "he gives rain on the earth, and sends water on the fields;",
      "11": "he sets the lowly on high, that those who mourn are raised to safety.",
      "12": "He frustrates the plans of the crafty so that their hands cannot accomplish what they had planned.",
      "13": "He catches the wise in their own craftiness, and the counsel of the cunning is brought to a quick end.",
      "14": "They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope about in the noontime as if it were night.",
      "15": "So he saves from the sword that comes from their mouth, even the poor from the hand of the powerful.",
      "16": "Thus the poor have hope, and iniquity shuts its mouth.",
      "17": "“Therefore, blessed is the man whom God corrects, so do not despise the discipline of the Almighty.",
      "18": "For he wounds, but he also bandages; he strikes, but his hands also heal.",
      "19": "He will deliver you from six calamities; yes, in seven no evil will touch you.",
      "20": "In time of famine he will redeem you from death, and in time of war from the power of the sword.",
      "21": "You will be protected from malicious gossip, and will not be afraid of the destruction when it comes.",
      "22": "You will laugh at destruction and famine and need not be afraid of the beasts of the earth.",
      "23": "For you will have a pact with the stones of the field, and the wild animals will be at peace with you.",
      "24": "And you will know that your home will be secure, and when you inspect your domains, you will not be missing anything.",
      "25": "You will also know that your children will be numerous, and your descendants like the grass of the earth.",
      "26": "You will come to your grave in a full age, As stacks of grain are harvested in their season.",

      "3": "But because it is heavier than the sand of the sea, that is why my words have been wild.",
      "4": "For the arrows of the Almighty are within me; my spirit drinks their poison; God’s sudden terrors are arrayed against me.",
      "5": "“Does the wild donkey bray when it is near grass? Or does the ox bellow over its fodder?",
      "6": "Can food that is tasteless be eaten without salt? Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?",
      "7": "I have refused to touch such things; they are like loathsome food to me.",
      "8": "“Oh that my request would be realized, and that God would grant me what I long for!",
      "9": "And that God would be willing to crush me, that he would let loose his hand and kill me.",
