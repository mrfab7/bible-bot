      "1": "The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin,",
      "2": "to whom the word of the Lord came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.",
      "3": "It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, to the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the captivity of Jerusalem in the fifth month.",
      "4": "Now the word of the Lord came to me, saying,",
      "5": "“Before I formed you in the womb I knew you; and before you were born I sanctified you, and I ordained you a prophet to the nations.”",
      "6": "Then I said, “Ah, Lord God! Truly, I cannot speak, for I am a youth.”",
      "7": "But the Lord said to me, “Do not say, ‘I am a youth.’ For you shall go everywhere that I send you, and whatever I command you, you shall speak.",
      "8": "Do not be afraid of their faces. For I am with you to deliver you,” says the Lord.",
      "9": "Then the Lord put forth His hand and touched my mouth. And the Lord said to me, “Now, I have put My words in your mouth.",
      "10": "See, I have this day set you over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out and to pull down, to destroy and to throw down, to build and to plant.”",
      "11": "Moreover the word of the Lord came to me, saying, “Jeremiah, what do you see?” And I said, “I see a branch of an almond tree.”",
      "12": "Then the Lord said to me, “You have seen well. For I will hasten My word to perform it.”",
      "13": "The word of the Lord came to me the second time, saying, “What do you see?” And I said, “I see a boiling pot, and it is facing away from the north.”",
      "14": "Then the Lord said to me: Out of the north calamity will break forth on all the inhabitants of the land.",
      "15": "For I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, says the Lord. And they will come and they will set each one his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls all around, and against all the cities of Judah.",
      "16": "I will utter My judgments against them concerning all their wickedness, whereby they have forsaken Me and have burned incense to other gods, and have worshipped the works of their own hands.",
      "17": "You therefore gird up your loins and arise, and speak to them all that I command you. Do not be dismayed at their faces, lest I confound you before them.",
      "18": "For indeed, I have made you this day a fortified city and an iron pillar and bronze walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the officials, against the priests, and against the people of the land.",

      "3": "Israel is holy to the Lord, and the first fruits of His harvest. All who eat of it will become guilty; disaster will come upon them, says the Lord.",
      "4": "Hear the word of the Lord, O house of Jacob and all the families of the house of Israel.",
      "5": "Thus says the Lord: What iniquity have your fathers found in Me, that they have gone far from Me, and have walked after vanity and have become vain?",
      "6": "They did not say, “Where is the Lord who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, who led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought and of the shadow of death, through a land that no man passed through and where no man lived?”",
      "7": "And I brought you into a plentiful country to eat its fruit and its goodness. But when you entered, you defiled My land and made My heritage an abomination.",
      "8": "The priests did not say, “Where is the Lord?” And those who handle the law did not know Me; the shepherds also transgressed against Me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal and walked after things that do not profit.",
      "9": "Therefore I will yet contend with you, says the Lord, and with your sons’ sons I will contend.",
      "10": "For pass over the coastlands of Cyprus and see, and send to Kedar and consider diligently, and see if there is such a thing.",
      "11": "Has a nation changed their gods, though they are not gods? But My people have changed their glory for that which does not profit.",
      "12": "Be astonished at this, O heavens, and be horribly afraid, be very desolate, says the Lord.",
      "13": "For My people have committed two evils. They have forsaken Me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed out for themselves cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.",
      "14": "Is Israel a servant? Is he a homeborn slave? Why has he been plundered?",
      "15": "The young lions roared at him and roared loudly, and they made his land a waste; his cities have been destroyed, without inhabitant.",
      "16": "Also the men of Memphis and Tahpanhes have shaved the crown of your head.",
      "17": "Have you not brought this on yourself, in that you have forsaken the Lord your God when He led you in the way?",
      "18": "And now what are you doing in the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of the Nile? Or what are you doing in the way of Assyria, to drink the waters of the River?",
      "19": "Your own wickedness will correct you, and your backslidings will reprove you. Know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and bitter for you to have forsaken the Lord your God, and the fear of Me is not in you, says the Lord God of Hosts.",
      "20": "For long ago I have broken your yoke and burst your bonds; and you said, “I will not serve.” For upon every high hill and under every green tree you wander, playing the harlot.",
      "21": "Yet I had planted you a noble vine, a wholly faithful seed. How then have you turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine to Me?",
      "22": "For though you wash yourself with lye, and take much soap, yet your iniquity is marked before Me, says the Lord God.",
      "23": "How can you say, “I am not polluted, I have not gone after the Baals”? See your way in the valley. Know what you have done. You are a swift young camel entangling her ways,",
      "24": "a wild donkey used to the wilderness that sniffs the wind in her passion. In the time of her heat, who can turn her away? All those who seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they shall find her.",
      "25": "Withhold your foot from being unshod and your throat from thirst. But you said, “There is no hope. No! For I have loved strangers, and after them I will go.”",
      "26": "As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed. They, their kings, their officials, and their priests, and their prophets",
      "27": "say to a tree, “You are my father.” And to a stone, “You gave birth to me.” For they have turned their back to Me, and not their face. But in the time of their trouble they will say, “Arise and save us.”",
      "28": "But where are your gods that you have made for yourself? Let them arise, if they can save you in the time of your trouble; for according to the number of your cities are your gods, O Judah.",
      "29": "Why will you plead with Me? You all have transgressed against Me, says the Lord.",
      "30": "In vain I have smitten your children; they received no correction. Your own sword has devoured your prophets like a destroying lion.",
      "31": "O generation, consider the word of the Lord: Have I been a wilderness to Israel? A land of darkness? Why do My people say, “We are free to roam. We will come no more to You”?",
      "32": "Can a virgin forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? Yet My people have forgotten Me for days without number.",
      "33": "You prepare your way very well to seek love. Therefore you have also taught the wicked women your ways.",
      "34": "Also in your skirts is found the blood of the souls of the innocent poor. I have not found it by breaking in, but in spite of all these things.",
      "35": "Yet you say, “Because I am innocent, surely His anger shall turn away from me.” Now I will plead with you, because you say, “I have not sinned.”",
      "36": "Why do you go about so much to change your way? You also shall be ashamed of Egypt, as you were ashamed of Assyria.",
      "37": "Indeed, you shall go forth from him with your hands upon your head; for the Lord has rejected those in whom you trust, and you shall not prosper in them."

      "2": "Lift up your eyes to the high places, and see! Where have you not been ravished? In the roads you have sat for them as the Arabian in the wilderness. And you have polluted the land with your harlotry and with your wickedness.",
      "3": "Therefore the showers have been withheld, and there has been no latter rain. And you had a harlot’s forehead; you refused to be ashamed.",
      "4": "Shall you not from this time cry to Me, “My Father, You are the guide of my youth?",
      "5": "Shall He reserve His anger forever? Shall He keep it to the end?” Indeed, you have spoken and done evil things as you could.",
      "6": "The Lord said also to me in the days of Josiah the king: Have you seen that which backsliding Israel has done? She has gone up on every high mountain and under every green tree, and there has played the harlot.",
      "7": "I said after she had done all these things, “Turn to Me.” But she did not return. And her treacherous sister Judah saw it.",
      "8": "I saw that for all the adulteries of backsliding Israel, I had put her away and given her a bill of divorce. Yet her treacherous sister Judah did not fear, but went and played the harlot also.",
      "9": "Through the lightness of her harlotry she defiled the land and committed adultery with stones and with trees.",
      "10": "Yet for all this, her treacherous sister Judah has not turned to Me with her whole heart, but feignedly, says the Lord.",
      "11": "The Lord said to me: Backsliding Israel has proved herself more righteous than treacherous Judah.",
      "12": "Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say: Return, backsliding Israel, says the Lord, and I will not cause My anger to fall on you. For I am merciful, says the Lord, and I will not keep anger forever.",
      "13": "Only acknowledge your iniquity, that you have transgressed against the Lord your God and have scattered your ways to the strangers under every green tree, and you have not obeyed My voice, says the Lord.",
      "14": "Return, O backsliding sons, says the Lord. For I am married to you. And I will take you, one from a city and two from a family, and I will bring you to Zion.",
      "15": "And I will give you shepherds according to My heart, who shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.",
      "16": "It shall come to pass when you are multiplied and increased in the land in those days, says the Lord, they will say no more, “The ark of the covenant of the Lord.” And it will not come to mind, nor will they remember it, nor will they call for it, nor will it be made any more.",
      "17": "At that time they will call Jerusalem, the Throne of the Lord, and all the nations will be gathered to it, to Jerusalem, for the name of the Lord; nor will they walk any more after the stubbornness of their evil hearts.",
      "18": "In those days the house of Judah will walk with the house of Israel, and they will come together out of the land of the north to the land that I have given to your fathers for an inheritance.",
      "19": "But I said: How can I put you among My sons and give you a pleasant land, the most beautiful heritage of the nations? And I said: You shall call Me, My Father, and shall not turn away from Me.",
      "20": "Surely as a wife treacherously departs from her husband, so you have dealt treacherously with Me, O house of Israel, says the Lord.",
      "21": "A voice was heard upon the high places, the weeping and the supplications of the sons of Israel, because they have perverted their way, they have forgotten the Lord their God.",
      "22": "Return, O backsliding sons, and I will heal your backslidings. “We come to You; for You are the Lord our God.",
      "23": "Truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills, and from the multitude of mountains. Truly, in the Lord our God is the salvation of Israel.",
      "24": "For shame has devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.",
      "25": "We lie down in our shame, and our humiliation covers us. For we have sinned against the Lord our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even to this day, and have not obeyed the voice of the Lord our God.”"

      "9": "It shall come to pass in that day, says the Lord, that the heart of the king will fail and the heart of the officials; and the priests will be astonished and the prophets will wonder.",
      "10": "Then I said, “Ah, Lord God! Surely You have greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, ‘You shall have peace,’ whereas the sword reaches the throat.”",
      "11": "At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem: A dry wind of the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter of My people, not to fan or to cleanse,",
      "12": "even a full wind from those places, will come to Me. Now also I will pronounce judgments against them.",

      "26": "I looked, and the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all the cities were broken down at the presence of the Lord, and by His fierce anger.",
      "27": "For thus says the Lord: The whole land shall be desolate. Yet I will not make a full end.",
      "28": "For this the earth shall mourn, and the heavens above be black, because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and will not relent, nor will I turn back from it.",

      "5": "I will go to the great men and will speak to them, for they have known the way of the Lord and the judgment of their God.” But these have altogether broken the yoke and burst the bonds.",

      "7": "How shall I pardon you for this? Your children have forsaken Me and sworn by those who are not gods. When I had fed them to the full, then they committed adultery and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots’ houses.",

And though the waves toss themselves, yet they cannot prevail; though they roar, yet they cannot pass over it.",
