      "3": "to receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, judgment, and equity;",
      "4": "to give subtlety to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion—",
      "5": "a wise man will hear and will increase learning, and a man of understanding will attain wise counsel,",
      "6": "to understand a proverb and the interpretation, the words of the wise and their riddles.",
      "7": "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and instruction.",
      "8": "My son, hear the instruction of your father, and do not forsake the teaching of your mother;",
      "9": "for they will be a garland of grace on your head, and chains about your neck.",
      "10": "My son, if sinners entice you, do not consent.",
      "11": "If they say, “Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood; let us lurk secretly for the innocent without cause;",
      "12": "let us swallow them up alive as the grave, and whole, as those who go down into the pit;",
      "13": "we will find all kinds of precious possessions; we will fill our houses with spoil;",
      "14": "cast in your lot among us, let us all have one purse”—",
      "15": "my son, do not walk in the way with them, keep your foot from their path;",
      "16": "for their feet run to evil and make haste to shed blood.",
      "17": "Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.",
      "18": "They lie in wait for their own blood; they lurk secretly for their own lives.",
      "19": "So are the ways of everyone who is greedy of gain, which takes away the life of its owners.",
      "20": "Wisdom cries out in the street; she utters her voice in the markets.",
      "21": "She cries at the corner of the streets, in the openings of the gates; she speaks her words in the city, saying:",
      "22": "“How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity? For the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge.",
      "23": "Turn at my reproof; surely I will pour out my spirit on you; I will make my words known to you.",
      "24": "Because I have called and you refused, I have stretched out my hand and no man regarded,",
      "25": "because you neglected all my counsel, and would have none of my reproof,",
      "26": "I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear comes,",
      "27": "when your fear comes as desolation and your destruction comes as a whirlwind, when distress and anguish come upon you.",
      "28": "“Then they will call on me, but I will not answer; they will seek me early, but they will not find me.",
      "29": "Because they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the Lord,",
      "30": "they would have none of my counsel and despised all my reproof.",
      "31": "Therefore they will eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.",

      "15": "She is more precious than rubies, and all the things you may desire are not to be compared with her.",
      "16": "Length of days is in her right hand, and in her left hand riches and honor.",
      "17": "Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.",
      "18": "She is a tree of life to those who take hold of her, and happy is everyone who retains her.",
      "19": "The Lord by wisdom has founded the earth; by understanding He has established the heavens;",
