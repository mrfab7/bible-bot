      "5": "I will break the bars of the gates of Damascus, and I will cut off the one seated in the Valley of Aven, and the one who holds a scepter in Beth Eden. So the people of Aram will go into exile toward Kir. The Lord has spoken.",
      "6": "This is what the Lord says: Because of three sins of Gaza, because of four, I will not hold back judgment, because they sold an entire population into exile, handing them over to Edom.",
      "7": "So I will send fire against the city wall of Gaza, and it will consume her citadels.",
      "8": "I will cut off the one seated in Ashdod, and the one who holds a scepter in Ashkelon. I will also turn my hand against Ekron, and what is left of the Philistines will perish. The Lord God has spoken.",
      "9": "This is what the Lord says: Because of three sins of Tyre, because of four, I will not hold back judgment, because they delivered over an entire population and exiled them to Edom, and they did not remember a treaty of brotherhood.",
      "10": "So I will send fire against the city wall of Tyre, and it will consume her citadels.",
      "11": "This is what the Lord says: Because of three sins of Edom, because of four, I will not hold back judgment, because he pursued his brother with a sword, and he had no compassion. His anger kept tearing Israel apart, and his fury raged without stopping.",

      "13": "This is what the Lord says: Because of three sins of the Ammonites, because of four, I will not hold back judgment, because they ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead in order to enlarge their own territory.",

      "6": "This is what the Lord says: Because of three sins of Israel, because of four, I will not hold back judgment, because they sell the righteous for silver and the needy for a pair of sandals.",
      "7": "They trample the heads of the poor into the dust of the earth, and they turn aside the claims of the oppressed. A man and his father go to the same young woman. In this way they profane my holy name.",
      "8": "They stretch themselves out beside every altar on pieces of clothing they seized as collateral. In the temple of their gods they drink wine obtained through fines.",

      "11": "I raised up some of your sons to be prophets, and some of your best young men to be Nazirites. Is this not so, you people of Israel? declares the Lord.",
      "12": "But you made the Nazirites drink wine, and you commanded the prophets, “You must not prophesy!”",

      "7": "Certainly the Lord God does not do anything without revealing his plan to his servants the prophets.",
      "8": "A lion has roared! Who can avoid being terrified? The Lord God has spoken! Who can hold back from prophesying?",
      "9": "Make this known to the citadels in Ashdod and to the citadels in the land of Egypt. Tell them, “Gather yourselves together on the mountains of Samaria. See the great confusion there and the oppression in her midst.”",
      "10": "They do not know how to do what is right, declares the Lord. They are storing up violence and destruction in their citadels.",
      "11": "Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: An enemy is all over the land. He will strip your strength from you, and your citadels will be plundered.",
      "12": "This is what the Lord says: Just as a shepherd rescues two legs or a tip of an ear from the mouth of a lion, so the Israelites who live in Samaria will be rescued with only a corner of a bed or a piece of cloth from a couch.",
      "13": "Listen and testify against the house of Jacob, declares the Lord God, the God of Armies.",
      "14": "Indeed, on the day when I punish the rebellious deeds of Israel, I will punish the altars of Bethel. The horns of the altar will be cut off, and they will fall to the ground.",

      "6": "I am the one who gave to you clean teeth in all of your cities, and lack of food in all your places, but you did not return to me, declares the Lord.",
      "7": "I am the one who withheld the rain from you while there were still three months before the harvest. I would send rain on one city, but on another city I would not send rain. One plot of ground would receive rain, but another plot, on which it did not rain, would dry up.",
      "8": "Whenever people from two or three cities staggered to another city to get water to drink, they would not have enough, but you did not return to me, declares the Lord.",
      "9": "I struck you with blight and mildew. Your many gardens, your vineyards, your fig trees, and your olive trees were devoured by locusts, but you did not return to me, declares the Lord.",
      "10": "I sent plagues against you like the plagues in Egypt. I killed your best soldiers with the sword, together with your captured horses. I made the stench of your camp rise up into your nostrils, but you did not return to me, declares the Lord.",
      "11": "I overthrew some of you, just as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and you became like a burning stick snatched from the fire, but you did not return to me, declares the Lord.",

      "10": "There are those who hate an arbitrator in the city gate. They despise anyone who speaks honestly.",

      "12": "For I know that your rebellious deeds are many, and your sins are numerous, you who are enemies of a righteous man, you who take bribes. They thrust away needy people in the city gate.",
      "13": "That is why a prudent man will be silent in that time, because it is an evil time.",
      "14": "Seek good and not evil, so that you may live, and then it will be like this for you: The Lord, the God of Armies, will be with you, as you claim.",
      "15": "Hate evil and love good. Establish justice in the city gate. Perhaps the Lord, the God of Armies, will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.",
