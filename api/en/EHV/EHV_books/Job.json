  "Job": {
    "1": {
      "1": "There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job. This man was blameless and upright, a man who feared God and turned away from evil.",
      "2": "Seven sons and three daughters were born to him.",
      "3": "His possessions included seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred female donkeys. He also had a very large retinue of servants. This man was the greatest of all the men of the East.",
      "4": "His sons would regularly arrange feasts, each one in his own house on his assigned day, and they would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.",
      "5": "When the days of the feast were complete, Job would send for them and consecrate them. Early in the morning he would sacrifice a burnt offering for each of them. Job would say, “Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.” Job did this regularly.",
      "6": "There came a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came into their midst.",
      "7": "The Lord said to Satan, “Where have you come from?” Satan answered the Lord, “From roaming the earth and walking around on it.”",
      "8": "Then the Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one like him on the earth, a man who is blameless and upright, who fears God and turns away from evil.”",
      "9": "Satan answered the Lord, “Is it without cause that Job fears God?",
      "10": "You have put a protective hedge around him and his household and everything that belongs to him, haven’t you? You have blessed the work of his hands. His livestock has spread throughout the land.",
      "11": "But just stretch out your hand and strike everything that is his, and he will certainly curse you to your face!”",
      "12": "So the Lord said to Satan, “Very well, then. Everything that he has is in your hand. But you may not stretch out your hand against the man himself.” So Satan left the presence of the Lord.",
      "13": "One day when Job’s sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their oldest brother,",
      "14": "a messenger came to Job and said, “The oxen were plowing and the female donkeys were grazing nearby,",
      "15": "when the Sabeans swooped down and took them away. They put the servants to death with the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!”",
      "16": "While he was still speaking, another servant came and said, “The fire of God fell from the sky and burned up the flocks and the servants and consumed them, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!”",
      "17": "While he was still speaking, another servant came and said, “The Chaldeans formed three raiding parties and plundered the camels and took them away. They put the servants to death with the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!”",
      "18": "While he was still speaking, another servant came and said, “Your sons and daughters were eating and were drinking wine in the house of their oldest brother.",
      "19": "Suddenly a powerful wind swept in from the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it collapsed on the young people, and they died, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!”",
      "20": "Then Job stood up, tore his robe, and shaved his head. He fell to the ground and worshipped.",
      "21": "Then he said, “Naked I came from my mother’s womb, and naked I will return. The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away. May the name of the Lord be blessed.”",
      "22": "In all this, Job did not sin or blame God."
    },
    "2": {
      "1": "Another day arrived when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came into their midst.",
      "2": "The Lord said to Satan, “Where have you come from?” Satan answered the Lord, “From roaming the earth and walking around on it.”",
      "3": "Then the Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one like him on the earth, a man who is blameless and upright, who fears God and turns away from evil. And he still maintains his integrity, even though you incited me against him to destroy him for no reason.”",
      "4": "Satan answered the Lord, “Skin for skin! A man will give all he has for his life.",
      "5": "But stretch out your hand and strike his bones and flesh, and he will certainly curse you to your face!”",
      "6": "The Lord said to Satan, “Very well, then, he is in your hand, but preserve his life.”",
      "7": "Satan then went out from the presence of the Lord. He struck Job with very painful sores from the sole of his foot to the top of his head.",
      "8": "So Job took a piece of broken pottery to scrape himself as he was sitting among the ashes.",
      "9": "Then his wife said to him, “Are you still maintaining your integrity? Curse God and die!”",
      "10": "But he said to her, “You are talking like a woman who lacks moral judgment. If we accept the good that comes from God, shouldn’t we also accept the bad?” In all this, Job did not sin in what he said.",
      "11": "Three friends of Job heard about all this adversity that had come upon him, and each of them came from his own homeland: Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Na’amathite. They met together and went to sympathize with Job and to comfort him.",
      "12": "When they caught sight of Job from a distance, they did not recognize him. They raised their voices and wept. Each man tore his robe and tossed dust into the air and onto his head.",
      "13": "They sat on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights, but no one spoke a word to him because they saw that his suffering was very great."
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "Finally, Job opened his lips and cursed the day of his birth.",
      "2": "Job spoke up and said:",
      "3": "May the day of my birth perish, and the night when it was said, “A child has been conceived!”",
      "4": "As for that day, let it be darkness! May God above have no concern for it. May light not shine on it.",
      "5": "May darkness and the shadow of death reclaim it. May a dark cloud settle over it. May whatever blackens the day terrify it.",
      "6": "As for that night, may deep darkness take it away! May it not be included among the days of the year or show up in the list of months.",
      "7": "Oh let that night be barren! May no joyful shout be heard in it.",
      "8": "May those who curse days cast a spell on it, those who are able to awaken Leviathan.",
      "9": "May its twilight stars be darkened. May it wait hopefully for light but receive none. May it never see the eyelids of dawn,",
      "10": "because it did not shut the doors of my mother’s womb, and it did not hide trouble from my eyes.",
      "11": "Why did I not die at birth or pass away as I came from the womb?",
      "12": "Why did my mother’s knees receive me? Why were her breasts there to nurse me?",
      "13": "For then I would be lying down peacefully. I would be sleeping and resting quietly",
      "14": "with the kings and counselors of the earth, with those who rebuilt ruined cities for themselves,",
      "15": "with high officials who accumulated gold, with those who filled their houses with silver.",
      "16": "Why was I not hidden like a stillborn child, like the infants who never see the light of day?",
      "17": "There the wicked cease from turmoil. There the weary are at rest.",
      "18": "There the prisoners are at ease together. They no longer hear the voice of the slave driver.",
      "19": "There the small and great are alike, and the slave is free from his master.",
      "20": "Why is light given to those weighed down with grief? Why is life given to those whose spirit is bitter,",
      "21": "to those who yearn for death but it does not come, though they dig for it more than for buried treasure,",
      "22": "to those who will be thrilled with happiness, those who will celebrate when they reach the grave?",
      "23": "Why is light given to a man whose path is hidden, to one whom God has hedged in?",
      "24": "Now my sighing takes the place of my daily bread. My groans gush forth like water,",
      "25": "because what I feared has overwhelmed me, and that which I dreaded has come upon me.",
      "26": "I have no ease, no quiet, no rest. Instead, turmoil has come."
    },
    "4": {
      "1": "Then Eliphaz the Temanite responded:",
      "2": "If someone ventures to have a word with you, will you grow impatient? But who can refrain from speaking up?",
      "3": "You yourself have instructed many, and you have strengthened weak hands.",
      "4": "Your words have raised up people who were stumbling, and you have given support to buckling knees.",
      "5": "But now that this has happened to you, you grow impatient. This strikes you and you are disturbed.",
      "6": "Shouldn’t your piety give you confidence? Don’t your blameless ways give you reason to hope?",
      "7": "Now remember this: Who has ever perished if he was innocent? Where were the upright ever erased?",
      "8": "This is what I have observed: Those who plow evil and sow trouble will reap the same.",
      "9": "By the breath of God they perish. By the blast from his nostrils they come to an end.",
      "10": "The lion roars, and the fierce lion growls, but the teeth of the young lion are broken.",
      "11": "The strong lion perishes from a lack of prey, and the cubs of the lioness are scattered.",
      "12": "A word was delivered to me secretly. My ears caught a whisper of it.",
      "13": "In the middle of anxious thoughts arising from visions in the night, at the time when deep sleep falls upon people,",
      "14": "terror and trembling came over me and made all my bones tremble.",
      "15": "A spirit passed in front of my face. The hair on my body stood on end.",
      "16": "A figure stood in front of me, but I could not tell what it was. A form stood before my eyes, and I heard a quiet voice say,",
      "17": "“Can a person be righteous before God? Can a man be pure before his Maker?”",
      "18": "If God does not trust his own servants, if he charges his messengers with error,",
      "19": "how much more those who dwell in clay houses, whose foundations are in the dust, who are crushed more quickly than a moth!",
      "20": "From dawn to dusk they are smashed to pieces. They perish forever, and no one even notices.",
      "21": "Won’t the ropes that hold up their tents be pulled up, so that they die without gaining wisdom?"
    },
    "5": {
      "1": "Call out! Is there anyone there to answer you? To which of the holy ones will you turn?",
      "2": "It’s true, the fool is killed by resentment, and the gullible are put to death by jealousy.",
      "3": "I myself have seen a fool putting down roots, but immediately I pronounced a curse on his home.",
      "4": "His children are far from safety. They are crushed at the city gate without a defender.",
      "5": "His harvest is eaten by the hungry, who snatch it away, even from among the thorns, and the thirsty swallow his children’s wealth.",
      "6": "Disaster does not just spring up from the dust, nor does trouble sprout from the soil.",
      "7": "No, mankind is born for trouble as surely as flames fly upward.",
      "8": "But I want to appeal to God. I want to present my case to him.",
      "9": "He does great things that are beyond investigation, and miracles that are too many to be counted.",
      "10": "He provides rain for the earth. He waters the fields in the countryside.",
      "11": "He raises the lowly to the heights, and he lifts those who mourn to safety.",
      "12": "He foils the plots of clever schemers, so that their hands achieve no success.",
      "13": "He traps the wise in their schemes, and the plans of the devious come to a swift end.",
      "14": "By day they encounter darkness, and at noon they grope around as if it were night.",
      "15": "He saves the poor from mouths that cut like a sword and from the hand of the strong.",
      "16": "He does this so that the helpless will have hope, and injustice will shut its mouth.",
      "17": "Consider this: How blessed is the man whom God corrects! Do not reject the discipline of the Almighty!",
      "18": "For though he may inflict wounds, he also bandages them. Though he may strike, his hands also heal.",
      "19": "From six calamities he will rescue you. In seven no harm will touch you.",
      "20": "In famine he will redeem you from death, and in battle he will redeem you from the power of the sword.",
      "21": "You will be hidden from the lash of the tongue, and you will not be afraid of devastation when it comes.",
      "22": "You will laugh at devastation and hunger. You will not be afraid of the wild animals of the countryside,",
      "23": "because there will be a covenant between you and the stones in the field, and the wild animals will be at peace with you.",
      "24": "You will know that your tent is secure, and when you inspect your property, you will find nothing missing.",
      "25": "You will know that your offspring will be many, and your descendants will be like grass from the earth.",
      "26": "You will come to the grave at a ripe old age, like a stack of sheaves that is gathered in season.",
      "27": "Consider this: We have investigated this carefully, and it is true! Pay close attention and apply it to yourself!"
    },
    "6": {
      "1": "Then Job responded:",
      "2": "If only my grief could be weighed, and my devastation placed on the scales with it!",
      "3": "They would certainly weigh more than the sand of the sea! No wonder my words have been rash.",
      "4": "The arrows of the Almighty stick in me. My spirit drinks in their poison. The terrors of God are lined up against me.",
      "5": "Does the wild donkey bray when it has green grass? Does the ox bellow when it is near its fodder?",
      "6": "Is tasteless food eaten without salt? Is there flavor in the white of an egg?",
      "7": "I absolutely refuse to touch it. It is no better than sickening food.",
      "8": "If only my request would be granted. If only God would grant me what I hope for:",
      "9": "that God would decide to crush me, that he would unleash his hand and cut me off.",
      "10": "For then I would still have this comfort: Even as I writhe in relentless pain, I have not denied the words of the Holy One.",
      "11": "What strength do I have to wait hopefully? What end awaits me that would make me want to prolong my life?",
      "12": "Is my strength like stone, or is my flesh bronze?",
      "13": "Certainly I have no power to help myself, since the hope that I can recover has been driven far away from me.",
      "14": "A despairing person should receive loyalty from his friends, even if he forsakes the fear of the Almighty.",
      "15": "But my brothers are as undependable as gullies that dry up, undependable as seasonal streams which overflow",
      "16": "when they are darkened by ice and swollen with melting snow,",
      "17": "but as quickly as they flood, they dry up in the scorching winds. When it gets hot, they vanish from their channels.",
      "18": "Caravans turn aside from their routes. They go off into the empty wasteland and perish.",
      "19": "The caravans of Tema search for these streams. The travelers of Sheba hope to find them,",
      "20": "but despite being confident, they are disappointed. They arrive there only to be frustrated.",
      "21": "Now that is what you are like! You have seen something dreadful and you panic.",
      "22": "Have I said, “Give me something, or offer a payment on my behalf from your wealth”?",
      "23": "Have I said, “Save me from the hand of my enemy, or redeem me from the hand of the ruthless”?",
      "24": "Teach me and I will be silent. Help me understand what I have done wrong.",
      "25": "How painful honest words are! But what does your rebuke prove?",
      "26": "Do you intend to attack me for mere words by treating things said by a despairing man like wind?",
      "27": "No doubt you would even cast lots for a fatherless child and barter away your friend!",
      "28": "But now, please look at me. I would not lie to your face!",
      "29": "Turn to me, and get rid of injustice. Turn to me. My righteousness is still intact.",
      "30": "Is there any injustice on my tongue? Wouldn’t my mouth detect it if I were speaking destructive words?"
    },
    "7": {
      "1": "Isn’t man’s time on earth like being compelled to serve in the army? Aren’t his days like those of a hired man?",
      "2": "Like a slave, he longs for shade, or like a day laborer, he waits for his pay.",
      "3": "In the same way, I have been allotted months of futility, and nights of agony have been assigned to me.",
      "4": "When I lie down, I think, “How long before I get up?” But the night drags on, and I am filled with restlessness until dawn.",
      "5": "My flesh is clothed with maggots and caked with dirt. My skin scabs over and then oozes again.",
      "6": "My days pass by more swiftly than the shuttle of a weaver’s loom. They come to an end without hope.",
      "7": "Remember that my life is just a breath. My eyes will never again see good fortune.",
      "8": "The eyes that see me now will no longer watch me. Your eyes will look for me, but I will not be there.",
      "9": "As a cloud vanishes and is gone, so does the one who goes down to the grave. He does not come back up again.",
      "10": "He never again returns to his home, and his place will no longer know him.",
      "11": "That is why I will not restrain my mouth. I will speak out in the anguish of my spirit. I will lament in the bitterness of my soul.",
      "12": "Am I the sea or a great creature of the deep that you need to put me under guard?",
      "13": "When I say that my bed will comfort me, and my couch will help me with my lament,",
      "14": "then you frighten me with dreams and terrify me with visions,",
      "15": "so I would prefer to be strangled, and I prefer death more than my current existence.",
      "16": "I reject my life. I do not want to live forever. Leave me alone, for my days are just a vanishing vapor.",
      "17": "What is man that you make so much of him, that you pay so much attention to him,",
      "18": "that you inspect him every morning and test him every minute?",
      "19": "Why do you never stop watching me? Why don’t you leave me alone long enough for me to swallow my spit?",
      "20": "If I have sinned, what harm has it done to you, you who keep watch on mankind? Why have you set me up as your target? How have I become a burden to you?",
      "21": "Why do you not forgive my rebellion? Why do you not take away my guilt? Soon I will lie down in the dust. You will search for me, but I will not be there."
    },
    "8": {
      "1": "Then Bildad the Shuhite responded:",
      "2": "How long will you say such things? How long will the words of your mouth be like a blustery wind?",
      "3": "Does God pervert justice? Does the Almighty pervert what is right?",
      "4": "When your children sinned against him, he handed them over to the consequences of their rebellion.",
      "5": "But if you will eagerly seek God and plead for compassion from the Almighty,",
      "6": "if you are pure and upright, then even now he will rouse himself on your behalf, and he will restore your rightful dwelling place.",
      "7": "Then, though your beginnings were small, your final days will be very great!",
      "8": "Yes, ask the previous generations, and consider the discoveries of their fathers,",
      "9": "because we were born only yesterday and know nothing. Our days on earth are nothing but a shadow.",
      "10": "Aren’t our ancestors the ones who should teach you and inform you, the ones who brought forth words from their hearts?",
      "11": "Does papyrus grow tall where there is no marsh? Do reeds thrive where there is no water?",
      "12": "While they are still growing and uncut, they can wither faster than any other plant.",
      "13": "This is the way it will be for all those who forget God. The hope of the godless man perishes.",
      "14": "His source of confidence is fragile. He trusts in something as fragile as a spider’s web.",
      "15": "He leans on his web, but it does not support him. He grasps it, but it does not hold him up.",
      "16": "He is a thriving plant flourishing in the sunshine, spreading its shoots over the garden.",
      "17": "It wraps its roots around a heap of rocks. It finds a home among the stones.",
      "18": "But if it is uprooted from its place, that place disowns it, saying, “I have never seen you!”",
      "19": "Yes, the only good thing that comes from this situation is that from the dust another plant sprouts.",
      "20": "Certainly God does not reject a blameless man or strengthen the hand of evildoers.",
      "21": "He will again fill your mouth with laughter and your lips with a joyful shout.",
      "22": "Your enemies will be clothed with shame, and the tents of the wicked will be no more."
    },
    "9": {
      "1": "Then Job responded:",
      "2": "Of course I know that this is true. But how can a man be justified before God?",
      "3": "If someone wants to argue with God, he could not refute one charge out of a thousand.",
      "4": "God has a wise heart and great power, so who can resist God and come out of it unharmed?",
      "5": "God removes mountains from their position, and they don’t even realize it. He overturns mountains in his anger.",
      "6": "He shakes the earth off its foundation. He causes its pillars to quake.",
      "7": "He speaks to the sun, and it does not rise, and he seals up the stars.",
      "8": "He alone stretches out the heavens. He treads on the crests of the sea.",
      "9": "He made the Bear, Orion, the Pleiades, and the constellations in the southern sky.",
      "10": "He does great things that are beyond investigation. He does miracles that are too many to be counted.",
      "11": "Though he passes by me, I do not see him. He moves past me, but I do not detect him.",
      "12": "If he snatches something away, who can make him bring it back? Who can say to him, “What are you doing?”",
      "13": "God does not hold back his anger. Even Rahab’s helpers bow down beneath him.",
      "14": "How much less, then, will I be able to answer him? I want to match words with him,",
      "15": "but even if I am in the right, I cannot answer him. I can only plead to my judge for grace.",
      "16": "If I called and he responded to me, I do not believe that he would listen to my voice.",
      "17": "With a violent storm he would crush me, and he would inflict many wounds on me for no reason.",
      "18": "He would not allow me to catch my breath. Instead, he would fill me with bitter experiences.",
      "19": "If it is a question of strength, he definitely is the strong one. If it is a question of jurisdiction, who can summon him?",
      "20": "Even if I am righteous, my mouth would still condemn me. If I am blameless, it would pronounce me crooked.",
      "21": "Although I am blameless, I cannot evaluate myself. I reject my own life.",
      "22": "Here is why I say, “It makes no difference.” Blameless or wicked, he brings them all to the same end.",
      "23": "If a whip suddenly kills people, he makes fun of the despair of the innocent.",
      "24": "When a land is handed over to a wicked man, God blinds the eyes of its judges. If he is not the one, then who does it?",
      "25": "My days are swifter than a runner. They fly away without bringing any happiness.",
      "26": "They glide by like reed boats, like an eagle that swoops down on its prey.",
      "27": "If I say, “I will forget my complaint. I will put on a happy face and smile,”",
      "28": "even then I dread all my pain, because I know that you will not acquit me.",
      "29": "I have already been declared guilty, so why should I struggle for nothing.",
      "30": "If I wash myself with snow, if I cleanse my hands with strong soap,",
      "31": "then you will plunge me into a cesspool, and my clothes will detest me.",
      "32": "For he is not a man as I am, so that I am able to answer him, so that we may meet in court.",
      "33": "There is no one to mediate between us, no one who can lay his hand on both of us.",
      "34": "No one can make him take his rod away from me, so that the dread of him would not fill me with terror!",
      "35": "If that happened, I would speak up and not be afraid. But I have no such mediator. I am left on my own."
    },
    "10": {
      "1": "With all my heart I am weary of my life, so I will express my complaint freely. I will speak from the bitterness of my heart.",
      "2": "I will say this to God: Do not condemn me. Tell me why you are pressing charges against me.",
      "3": "Is it good that you are oppressing me, that you are rejecting what your hands have made, at the same time that you favor the plans of the wicked?",
      "4": "Do you have eyes made of flesh? Do you see things the way a man does?",
      "5": "Are your days like a man’s days? Are your years like the life span of a human?",
      "6": "You do, in fact, investigate guilt, and you do search carefully for sin.",
      "7": "Although you know that I am not guilty, there is no one who can rescue me from your hand.",
      "8": "Your hands shaped me and made me, but now you swallow me up completely.",
      "9": "Please remember that it was you who shaped me like a clay pot. Will you now return me to the dust?",
      "10": "Aren’t you the one who poured me out like milk, who thickened me like a curd of cheese?",
      "11": "You clothed me with skin and flesh. You wove me together with bones and tendons.",
      "12": "You provided me with life and mercy, and your watchful care has guarded my spirit.",
      "13": "You hid these things in your heart, but I know that this is what you had in mind:",
      "14": "If I sinned and you were watching me, you would not acquit me of my guilt.",
