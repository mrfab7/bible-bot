      "14": "Draw water for the siege; strengthen your forts; trample the clay; tread the mortar; take hold of the brick mold!",
      "15": "There the fire will devour you; the sword will cut you off. It will devour you like the locust. Multiply yourselves like the locust; multiply like the grasshopper!",
      "16": "You increased your merchants more than the stars of the heavens. The locust sheds its skin and flies away.",
