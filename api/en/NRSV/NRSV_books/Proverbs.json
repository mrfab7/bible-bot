      "4": "to teach shrewdness to the simple, knowledge and prudence to the young—",
      "5": "let the wise, too, hear and gain in learning and the discerning acquire skill,",
      "6": "to understand a proverb and a figure, the words of the wise and their riddles.",
      "7": "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction.",
      "8": "Hear, my child, your father’s instruction, and do not reject your mother’s teaching,",
      "9": "for they are a fair garland for your head and pendants for your neck.",
      "10": "My child, if sinners entice you, do not consent.",
      "11": "If they say, “Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood; let us wantonly ambush the innocent;",

      "23": "Give heed to my reproof; I will pour out my thoughts to you; I will make my words known to you.",
      "24": "Because I have called and you refused, have stretched out my hand and no one heeded,",
      "25": "and because you have ignored all my counsel and would have none of my reproof,",
      "26": "I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when panic strikes you,",
      "27": "when panic strikes you like a storm and your calamity comes like a whirlwind, when distress and anguish come upon you.",
      "28": "Then they will call upon me, but I will not answer; they will seek me diligently but will not find me.",
      "29": "Because they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the Lord,",
