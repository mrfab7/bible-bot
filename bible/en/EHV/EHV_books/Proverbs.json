      "1": "The proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel.",
      "2": "To learn wisdom and discipline, to understand sayings that give insight,",
      "3": "to acquire discipline to act sensibly, to acquire righteousness, justice, and fairness,",
      "4": "to give good judgment to the inexperienced, to give a young man knowledge and foresight.",
      "5": "A wise person should listen, and he will increase learning. A person with understanding should obtain guidance",
      "6": "so he will understand proverbs, puzzling statements, and the thought-provoking words of the wise.",
      "7": "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, but stubborn fools despise wisdom and discipline.",
      "8": "Listen, my son, to your father’s discipline, and do not forsake your mother’s teaching,",
      "9": "because they are a garland of grace for your head. They are jewelry for your neck.",
      "10": "My son, if sinners lure you, do not go along with them.",
      "11": "If they say, “Come with us. Let’s lie in wait to shed blood. Let’s hide and ambush an innocent person for no reason.",
      "12": "We will swallow them alive like the grave. We will swallow them whole like those who go down to the pit.",
      "13": "We will find all kinds of wealth and treasure. We will fill our houses with loot.",
      "14": "Cast your lot with us. We will all share one bag of money.”",
      "15": "My son, do not walk along the road with them. Do not set foot on their path,",
      "16": "because their feet run to do evil, and they hurry to shed blood.",
      "17": "How useless to spread a net in the sight of any bird!",
      "18": "Yet they set up an ambush for their own blood. They hide in ambush to take their own lives.",
      "19": "This is where the path leads for everyone who is greedy for stolen property: It takes away the life of those who possess it.",
      "20": "Wisdom calls out loudly in the street. In the public squares she raises her voice.",
      "21": "At the noisy street corners she calls out. At the entrances to the city gates she speaks her words:",
      "22": "“How long will you gullible people love being gullible? How long will scoffers delight in their scoffing? How long will fools hate knowledge?",
      "23": "If you respond to my warning, I will pour out my spirit for you. I will make my words known to you.",
      "24": "Because I called, but you refused to listen, because I stretched out my hand, but no one paid attention,",
      "25": "because you ignored all my advice, and you did not accept my warning,",
      "26": "therefore I will laugh at your calamity. I will jeer when terror strikes you,",
      "27": "when terror strikes you like a violent storm, when calamity strikes you like a windstorm, when trouble and distress come upon you.",
      "28": "Then they will call to me, but I will not answer. They will look for me, but they will not find me,",
      "29": "because they hated knowledge, and they did not choose the fear of the Lord.",
      "30": "They would not accept my advice, and they despised all my warnings.",
      "31": "So they will eat the fruit of their own way, and they will be stuffed with their own schemes.",
      "32": "Therefore the wandering ways of the gullible kill them, and the complacency of fools destroys them.",
      "33": "But whoever listens to me will live in safety. He will be secure, without fear of evil.”"

      "16": "Wisdom will save you from the immoral woman, from the unfaithful woman with her seductive words,",
      "17": "who abandons the husband of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God.",
      "18": "So she sinks down to death, which becomes her house. Her way of life leads down to the spirits of the dead.",
      "19": "All who enter her house never return. They never reach the paths of life.",
      "20": "This is how to walk in the way of good people, how to stay on the paths of the righteous.",
      "21": "Yes, the upright will live in the land, and people with integrity will remain in it,",

      "11": "Do not reject the Lord’s discipline, my son, and do not despise his warning,",
      "12": "because the Lord warns the one he loves as a father warns a son with whom he is pleased.",
      "13": "How blessed is the person who finds wisdom, the person who acquires understanding,",
      "14": "because the profit it gives is better than the profit from silver, and its yield is better than gold!",
      "15": "It is more valuable than gems, and nothing you desire can equal it.",
      "16": "In its right hand are the days of a long life. In its left hand are riches and honor.",
      "17": "Its ways are pleasant ways, and all its paths are peace.",
      "18": "It is a tree of life for those who hold on to it. Those who cling to it are blessed.",
      "19": "The Lord founded the earth by wisdom. He established the heavens by understanding.",
      "20": "By his knowledge the deep waters were divided, and the clouds drip dew.",
      "21": "My son, do not take your eyes off these things. Guard sound judgment and insight.",

      "26": "because the Lord will be your confidence. He will keep your foot from being caught.",
      "27": "Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due when it is within your power to give it.",

      "30": "Do not quarrel with a person for no good reason when he has done nothing to harm you.",
      "31": "Do not envy a violent person. Do not choose any of his ways,",
      "32": "because a crooked person is an abomination to the Lord, but God’s friendly guidance leads the upright.",
      "33": "The Lord’s curse rests on the house of the wicked, but he blesses the home of the righteous.",
