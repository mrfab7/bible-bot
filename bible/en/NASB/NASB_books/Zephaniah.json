      "2": "“I will completely remove all things From the face of the earth,” declares the Lord.",
      "3": "“I will remove human and animal life; I will remove the birds of the sky And the fish of the sea, And the ruins along with the wicked; And I will eliminate mankind from the face of the earth,” declares the Lord.",
      "4": "“So I will stretch out My hand against Judah And against all the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And I will eliminate the remnant of Baal from this place, And the names of the idolatrous priests along with the other priests.",

      "9": "And on that day I will punish all who leap on the temple threshold, Who fill the house of their lord with violence and deceit.",
      "10": "And on that day,” declares the Lord, “There will be the sound of a cry from the Fish Gate, Wailing from the Second Quarter, And a loud crash from the hills.",
      "11": "Wail, you inhabitants of the Mortar, Because all the people of Canaan will be destroyed; All who weigh out silver will be eliminated.",
      "12": "And it will come about at that time That I will search Jerusalem with lamps, And I will punish the people Who are stagnant in spirit, Who say in their hearts, ‘The Lord will not do good nor harm!’",
      "13": "Their wealth will become plunder, And their houses desolate; Yes, they will build houses but not inhabit them, And plant vineyards but not drink their wine.”",
      "14": "The great day of the Lord is near, Near and coming very quickly; Listen, the day of the Lord! In it the warrior cries out bitterly.",
      "15": "That day is a day of anger, A day of trouble and distress, A day of destruction and desolation, A day of darkness and gloom, A day of clouds and thick darkness,",
      "16": "A day of trumpet and battle cry Against the fortified cities And the high corner towers.",
      "17": "I will bring distress on mankind So that they will walk like those who are blind, Because they have sinned against the Lord; And their blood will be poured out like dust, And their flesh like dung.",
      "18": "Neither their silver nor their gold Will be able to save them On the day of the Lord’s anger; And all the earth will be devoured By the fire of His jealousy, For He will make a complete end, Indeed a horrifying one, Of all the inhabitants of the earth."

      "6": "So the seacoast will become grazing places, With pastures for shepherds and folds for flocks.",
      "7": "And the coast will be For the remnant of the house of Judah, They will drive sheep to pasture on it. In the houses of Ashkelon they will lie down at evening; For the Lord their God will care for them And restore their fortunes.",
      "8": "“I have heard the taunting of Moab And the abusive speech of the sons of Ammon, With which they have taunted My people And boasted against their territory.",
      "9": "Therefore, as I live,” declares the Lord of armies, The God of Israel, “Moab will assuredly be like Sodom, And the sons of Ammon like Gomorrah— Ground overgrown with weeds and full of salt mines, And a permanent desolation. The remnant of My people will plunder them, And the remainder of My nation will inherit them.”",
      "10": "This they will have in return for their arrogance, because they have taunted and boasted against the people of the Lord of armies.",
      "11": "The Lord will be terrifying to them, for He will starve all the gods of the earth; and all the coastlands of the nations will bow down to Him, everyone from his own place.",
      "12": "“You also, Ethiopians, will be slain by My sword.”",
      "13": "And He will stretch out His hand against the north And eliminate Assyria, And He will make Nineveh a desolation, Parched like the wilderness.",
      "14": "Flocks will lie down in her midst, All animals that range in herds; Both the pelican and the hedgehog Will spend their nights in the tops of her pillars; Birds will sing in the window, Devastation will be on the threshold; For He has uncovered the cedar work.",
      "15": "This is the presumptuous city That dwells securely, Who says in her heart, “I am, and there is no one besides me.” How she has become a desolation, A resting place for animals! Everyone who passes by her will hiss And wave his hand in contempt."

      "2": "She obeyed no voice, She accepted no discipline. She did not trust in the Lord, She did not approach her God.",
      "3": "Her leaders within her are roaring lions, Her judges are wolves at evening; They have no bones to gnaw in the morning.",
      "4": "Her prophets are insolent, treacherous men; Her priests have profaned the sanctuary. They have done violence to the Law.",
      "5": "The Lord is righteous within her; He will do no injustice. Every morning He brings His justice to light; He does not fail. But the criminal knows no shame.",
      "6": "“I have eliminated nations; Their corner towers are deserted. I have laid waste their streets, With no one passing by; Their cities have been laid waste, Without a person, without an inhabitant.",

      "9": "For then I will restore to the peoples pure lips, So that all of them may call on the name of the Lord, To serve Him shoulder to shoulder.",
      "10": "From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia My worshipers, My dispersed ones, Will bring My offerings.",
      "11": "On that day you will feel no shame Because of all your deeds By which you have rebelled against Me; For then I will remove from your midst Your proud, arrogant ones, And you will never again be haughty On My holy mountain.",
