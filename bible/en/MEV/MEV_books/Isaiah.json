      "1": "The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.",
      "2": "Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth. For the Lord has spoken: I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against Me;",
      "3": "the ox knows his owner, and the donkey his master’s crib, but Israel does not know; My people do not consider.",
      "4": "Alas, sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a brood of evildoers, children who deal corruptly! They have forsaken the Lord, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel to anger, they are estranged and backward.",
      "5": "Why should you be beaten again, that you revolt more and more? The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.",
      "6": "From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness in it. Wounds, bruises, and open sores; they have not been closed, nor bandaged, nor soothed with oil.",
      "7": "Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire; strangers devour your land in your presence; and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.",
      "8": "The daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard, like a hut in a field of melons, like a besieged city.",
      "9": "Unless the Lord of Hosts had left to us a very small remnant, we would have been as Sodom; we would have been like Gomorrah.",
      "10": "Hear the word of the Lord, you rulers of Sodom; listen to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah:",
      "11": "For what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to Me? says the Lord. I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed animals. I do not delight in the blood of bulls, or of lambs, or of male goats.",
      "12": "When you come to appear before Me, who has required this at your hand, to trample My courts?",
      "13": "Bring no more vain offerings; incense is an abomination to Me. New Moons, Sabbaths, and convocations— I cannot bear with evil assemblies.",
      "14": "My soul hates your New Moons and your appointed feasts; they are a burden to Me; I am weary of bearing them.",
      "15": "When you reach out your hands, I will hide My eyes from you; even when you make many prayers, I will not hear. Your hands are full of blood.",
      "16": "Wash yourselves, make yourselves clean; put away the evil from your deeds, from before My eyes. Cease to do evil,",
      "17": "learn to do good; seek justice, relieve the oppressed; judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.",
      "18": "Come now, and let us reason together, says the Lord. Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.",
      "19": "If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land;",
      "20": "but if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured with the sword; for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it.",
      "21": "How the faithful city has become a prostitute! She was full of justice; righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers.",
      "22": "Your silver has become dross, your wine mixed with water.",
      "23": "Your princes are rebellious and companions of thieves; everyone loves a bribe and follows after rewards. They do not defend the fatherless, nor does the cause of the widow come before them.",
      "24": "Therefore the Lord, the Lord of Hosts, the Mighty One of Israel, says: Ah, I will get relief from My adversaries, and avenge Myself on My enemies.",
      "25": "And I will turn My hand against you, thoroughly purge away your dross, and take away all your impurities.",
      "26": "I will restore your judges as at the first, and your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward you shall be called the city of righteousness, a faithful town.",
      "27": "Zion shall be redeemed with justice and her converts with righteousness.",
      "28": "But the destruction of the transgressors and sinners shall be together, and those who forsake the Lord shall be consumed.",
      "29": "For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which you have desired, and you shall be humiliated for the gardens that you have chosen.",
      "30": "For you shall be as an oak whose leaf fades, and as a garden that has no water.",
      "31": "The strong shall be as tinder, and his work like a spark; they will both burn together, and no one will quench them."

      "3": "Many people shall go and say, “Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob, and He will teach us of His ways, and we will walk in His paths.” For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.",
      "4": "He shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many peoples; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, nor shall they learn war any more.",
      "5": "O house of Jacob, come, and let us walk in the light of the Lord.",
      "6": "For You have forsaken Your people, the house of Jacob, because they are replenished from the east, and are soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves with the children of strangers.",
      "7": "Their land also is full of silver and gold, and there is no end to their treasures; their land is also full of horses, and there is no end to their chariots.",
      "8": "Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made.",
      "9": "And the common man bows down, and the great man humbles himself; therefore, do not forgive them.",
      "10": "Enter into the rock, and hide in the dust from the fear of the Lord and from the glory of His majesty.",
      "11": "The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.",
      "12": "For the day of the Lord of Hosts shall be upon everything that is proud and lofty, and upon everything that is lifted up, and it shall be brought low;",
      "13": "and it will be upon all the cedars of Lebanon that are high and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan,",
      "14": "and upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted up,",
      "15": "and upon all the high towers, and upon every fenced wall,",
      "16": "and upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant sloops.",
      "17": "The loftiness of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be brought low; the Lord alone will be exalted in that day;",
      "18": "the idols He shall utterly abolish.",
      "19": "They shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, from the fear of the Lord, and from the glory of His majesty, when He shall arise to shake the earth mightily.",
      "20": "In that day a man shall cast away his idols of silver and his idols of gold, which they made for themselves to worship, to the moles and to the bats,",
      "21": "to enter the caverns of the rocks, and into the clefts of the cliffs, from the terror of the Lord, and from the glory of His majesty, when He arises to shake the earth mightily.",

      "3": "the captain of fifty and the honorable man, the counselor and the skillful artisan, and the eloquent orator.",
      "4": "I will give youths to be their princes, and unweaned children shall rule over them.",
      "5": "The people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbor; the youth shall behave himself proudly against the elder, and the inferior against the honorable.",
      "6": "When a man shall take hold of his brother in the house of his father saying, “You have clothing; be our ruler, and let this ruin be under your power,”",
      "7": "in that day he shall swear saying, “I will not be a healer. For in my house is neither bread nor clothing; do not make me a ruler of the people.”",
      "8": "For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen, because their tongue and their deeds are against the Lord, to provoke the eyes of His glory.",
      "9": "The expression of their countenance witnesses against them, and they declare their sin as Sodom; they hide it not. Woe to them! For they have brought evil on themselves.",
      "10": "Say to the righteous that it shall be well with them, for they shall eat the fruit of their deeds.",
      "11": "Woe to the wicked! It shall be ill with him, for the reward of his hands shall be given him.",
