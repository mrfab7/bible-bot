      "1": "The vision of Isaiah son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.",
      "2": "Hear, O heavens, and listen, O earth, for the Lord has spoken: I reared children and brought them up, but they have rebelled against me.",
      "3": "The ox knows its owner and the donkey its master’s crib, but Israel does not know; my people do not understand.",
      "4": "Woe, sinful nation, people laden with iniquity, offspring who do evil, children who act corruptly, who have forsaken the Lord, who have despised the Holy One of Israel, who are utterly estranged!",
      "5": "Why do you seek further beatings? Why do you continue to rebel? The whole head is injured, and the whole heart faint.",
      "6": "From the sole of the foot to the head, there is no soundness in it, only bruises and sores and bleeding wounds; they have not been drained or bound up or softened with oil.",
      "7": "Your country lies desolate; your cities are burned with fire; in your very presence aliens devour your land; it is desolate, as overthrown by foreigners.",
      "8": "And daughter Zion is left like a booth in a vineyard, like a shelter in a cucumber field, like a besieged city.",
      "9": "If the Lord of hosts had not left us a few survivors, we would have been like Sodom and become like Gomorrah.",
      "10": "Hear the word of the Lord, you rulers of Sodom! Listen to the teaching of our God, you people of Gomorrah!",
      "11": "What to me is the multitude of your sacrifices? says the Lord; I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fed beasts; I do not delight in the blood of bulls or of lambs or of goats.",
      "12": "When you come to appear before me, who asked this from your hand? Trample my courts no more!",
      "13": "Bringing offerings is futile; incense is an abomination to me. New moon and Sabbath and calling of convocation— I cannot endure solemn assemblies with iniquity.",
      "14": "Your new moons and your appointed festivals my soul hates; they have become a burden to me; I am weary of bearing them.",
      "15": "When you stretch out your hands, I will hide my eyes from you; even though you make many prayers, I will not listen; your hands are full of blood.",
      "16": "Wash yourselves; make yourselves clean; remove your evil deeds from before my eyes; cease to do evil;",
      "17": "learn to do good; seek justice; rescue the oppressed; defend the orphan; plead for the widow.",
      "18": "Come now, let us argue it out, says the Lord: If your sins are like scarlet, will they become like snow? If they are red like crimson, will they become like wool?",
      "19": "If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land,",
      "20": "but if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured by the sword, for the mouth of the Lord has spoken.",
      "21": "How the faithful city has become a prostitute! She that was full of justice, righteousness lodged in her— but now murderers!",
      "22": "Your silver has become dross; your wine is mixed with water.",
      "23": "Your princes are rebels and companions of thieves. Everyone loves a bribe and runs after gifts. They do not defend the orphan, and the widow’s cause does not come before them.",
      "24": "Therefore says the Sovereign, the Lord of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel: Surely I will pour out my wrath on my enemies and avenge myself on my foes!",
      "25": "I will turn my hand against you; I will smelt away your dross as with lye and remove all your alloy.",
      "26": "And I will restore your judges as at the first and your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward you shall be called the city of righteousness, the faithful city.",
      "27": "Zion shall be redeemed by justice, and those in her who repent, by righteousness.",
      "28": "But rebels and sinners shall be destroyed together, and those who forsake the Lord shall be consumed.",
      "29": "For you shall be ashamed of the oaks in which you delighted, and you shall blush for the gardens that you have chosen.",
      "30": "For you shall be like an oak whose leaf withers and like a garden without water.",
      "31": "The strong shall become like tinder and their work like a spark; they and their work shall burn together, with no one to quench them."

      "3": "Many peoples shall come and say, “Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob, that he may teach us his ways and that we may walk in his paths.” For out of Zion shall go forth instruction and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.",
      "4": "He shall judge between the nations and shall arbitrate for many peoples; they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation; neither shall they learn war any more.",
      "5": "O house of Jacob, come, let us walk in the light of the Lord!",
      "6": "You have forsaken your people, the house of Jacob, for they are full of diviners from the East and of soothsayers like the Philistines, and they clasp hands with foreigners.",
      "7": "Their land is filled with silver and gold, and there is no end to their treasures; their land is filled with horses, and there is no end to their chariots.",
      "8": "Their land is filled with idols; they bow down to the work of their hands, to what their own fingers have made.",
      "9": "And so people are humbled, and everyone is brought low— do not forgive them!",
      "10": "Enter into the rock, and hide in the dust from the terror of the Lord and from the glory of his majesty.",
      "11": "The haughty eyes of people shall be brought low, and the pride of everyone shall be humbled, and the Lord alone will be exalted on that day.",
      "12": "For the Lord of hosts has a day against all that is proud and lofty, against all that is lifted up and high;",
      "13": "against all the cedars of Lebanon, lofty and lifted up; and against all the oaks of Bashan;",
      "14": "against all the high mountains and against all the lofty hills;",
      "15": "against every high tower and against every fortified wall;",
      "16": "against all the ships of Tarshish and against all the highly prized vessels.",
      "17": "The haughtiness of people shall be humbled, and the pride of everyone shall be brought low, and the Lord alone will be exalted on that day.",
      "18": "The idols shall utterly pass away.",
      "19": "Enter the caves of the rocks and the holes of the ground, from the terror of the Lord and from the glory of his majesty, when he rises to terrify the earth.",
      "20": "On that day people will throw away to the moles and to the bats their idols of silver and their idols of gold, which they made for themselves to worship,",
      "21": "to enter the caverns of the rocks and the clefts in the crags, from the terror of the Lord and from the glory of his majesty, when he rises to terrify the earth.",

      "4": "And I will make youths their princes, and children shall rule over them.",
      "5": "The people will be oppressed, everyone by another and everyone by a neighbor; the youth will be insolent to the elder and the base to the honorable.",
      "6": "Someone will seize a relative, a member of the clan, saying, “You have a cloak; you shall be our leader, and this heap of ruins shall be under your rule.”",
      "7": "But the other will cry out on that day, saying, “I will not be a healer; in my house there is neither bread nor cloak; you shall not make me leader of the people.”",
      "8": "For Jerusalem has stumbled, and Judah has fallen, because their speech and their deeds are against the Lord, defying his glorious presence.",
      "9": "The look on their faces bears witness against them; they proclaim their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it. Woe to them, for they have brought evil on themselves.",
      "10": "Tell the innocent how fortunate they are, for they shall eat the fruit of their labors.",
      "11": "Woe to the guilty! How unfortunate they are, for what their hands have done shall be done to them.",
      "12": "My people—their oppressors extort them, and creditors rule over them. O my people, your leaders mislead you and confuse the course of your paths.",
      "13": "The Lord rises to argue his case; he stands to judge the peoples.",
      "14": "The Lord enters into judgment with the elders and princes of his people: It is you who have devoured the vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your houses.",
      "15": "What do you mean by crushing my people, by grinding the face of the poor? says the Lord God of hosts.",

      "17": "Those who sanctify and purify themselves to go into the gardens, following the one in the center, eating the flesh of pigs, vermin, and rodents, shall come to an end together, says the Lord,",
      "18": "for I know their works and their thoughts. I am coming to gather all nations and tongues, and they shall come and shall see my glory,",
      "19": "and I will set a sign among them. From them I will send survivors to the nations, to Tarshish, Put, and Lud, to Meshech, Tubal, and Javan, to the coastlands far away that have not heard of my fame or seen my glory, and they shall declare my glory among the nations.",
      "20": "They shall bring all your kindred from all the nations as an offering to the Lord, on horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and on mules, and on dromedaries, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, says the Lord, just as the Israelites bring a grain offering in a clean vessel to the house of the Lord.",
      "21": "And I will also take some of them as priests and as Levites, says the Lord.",
      "22": "For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, says the Lord, so shall your descendants and your name remain.",
      "23": "From new moon to new moon and from Sabbath to Sabbath, all flesh shall come to worship before me, says the Lord.",
      "24": "And they shall go out and look at the dead bodies of the people who have rebelled against me, for their worm shall not die, their fire shall not be quenched, and they shall be an abhorrence to all flesh."
