      "10": "My child, if sinners entice you, turn your back on them!",
      "11": "They may say, “Come and join us. Let’s hide and kill someone! Just for fun, let’s ambush the innocent!",

      "28": "“When they cry for help, I will not answer. Though they anxiously search for me, they will not find me.",

      "31": "Therefore, they must eat the bitter fruit of living their own way, choking on their own schemes.",

      "17": "She will guide you down delightful paths; all her ways are satisfying.",
      "18": "Wisdom is a tree of life to those who embrace her; happy are those who hold her tightly.",
      "19": "By wisdom the Lord founded the earth; by understanding he created the heavens.",
      "20": "By his knowledge the deep fountains of the earth burst forth, and the dew settles beneath the night sky.",
      "21": "My child, don’t lose sight of common sense and discernment. Hang on to them,",
      "22": "for they will refresh your soul. They are like jewels on a necklace.",

      "2": "Then you will show discernment, and your lips will express what you’ve learned.",
      "3": "For the lips of an immoral woman are as sweet as honey, and her mouth is smoother than oil.",

      "13": "Oh, why didn’t I listen to my teachers? Why didn’t I pay attention to my instructors?",
      "14": "I have come to the brink of utter ruin, and now I must face public disgrace.”",
      "15": "Drink water from your own well— share your love only with your wife.",
      "16": "Why spill the water of your springs in the streets, having sex with just anyone?",
      "17": "You should reserve it for yourselves. Never share it with strangers.",
      "18": "Let your wife be a fountain of blessing for you. Rejoice in the wife of your youth.",
      "19": "She is a loving deer, a graceful doe. Let her breasts satisfy you always. May you always be captivated by her love.",
      "20": "Why be captivated, my son, by an immoral woman, or fondle the breasts of a promiscuous woman?",
      "21": "For the Lord sees clearly what a man does, examining every path he takes.",
      "22": "An evil man is held captive by his own sins; they are ropes that catch and hold him.",

      "7": "Though they have no prince or governor or ruler to make them work,",
      "8": "they labor hard all summer, gathering food for the winter.",
      "9": "But you, lazybones, how long will you sleep? When will you wake up?",
      "10": "A little extra sleep, a little more slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest—",
      "11": "then poverty will pounce on you like a bandit; scarcity will attack you like an armed robber.",
      "12": "What are worthless and wicked people like? They are constant liars,",

      "14": "Their perverted hearts plot evil, and they constantly stir up trouble.",
      "15": "But they will be destroyed suddenly, broken in an instant beyond all hope of healing.",
      "16": "There are six things the Lord hates— no, seven things he detests:",
      "17": "haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that kill the innocent,",
      "18": "a heart that plots evil, feet that race to do wrong,",

      "22": "When you walk, their counsel will lead you. When you sleep, they will protect you. When you wake up, they will advise you.",
      "23": "For their command is a lamp and their instruction a light; their corrective discipline is the way to life.",
      "24": "It will keep you from the immoral woman, from the smooth tongue of a promiscuous woman.",
      "25": "Don’t lust for her beauty. Don’t let her coy glances seduce you.",
      "26": "For a prostitute will bring you to poverty, but sleeping with another man’s wife will cost you your life.",
      "27": "Can a man scoop a flame into his lap and not have his clothes catch on fire?",
      "28": "Can he walk on hot coals and not blister his feet?",
      "29": "So it is with the man who sleeps with another man’s wife. He who embraces her will not go unpunished.",
      "30": "Excuses might be found for a thief who steals because he is starving.",
      "31": "But if he is caught, he must pay back seven times what he stole, even if he has to sell everything in his house.",
      "32": "But the man who commits adultery is an utter fool, for he destroys himself.",
      "33": "He will be wounded and disgraced. His shame will never be erased.",
      "34": "For the woman’s jealous husband will be furious, and he will show no mercy when he takes revenge.",
      "35": "He will accept no compensation, nor be satisfied with a payoff of any size."

      "6": "While I was at the window of my house, looking through the curtain,",
      "7": "I saw some naive young men, and one in particular who lacked common sense.",
      "8": "He was crossing the street near the house of an immoral woman, strolling down the path by her house.",
      "9": "It was at twilight, in the evening, as deep darkness fell.",
      "10": "The woman approached him, seductively dressed and sly of heart.",
      "11": "She was the brash, rebellious type, never content to stay at home.",
      "12": "She is often in the streets and markets, soliciting at every corner.",
      "13": "She threw her arms around him and kissed him, and with a brazen look she said,",

      "21": "So she seduced him with her pretty speech and enticed him with her flattery.",
      "22": "He followed her at once, like an ox going to the slaughter. He was like a stag caught in a trap,",
      "23": "awaiting the arrow that would pierce its heart. He was like a bird flying into a snare, little knowing it would cost him his life.",
      "24": "So listen to me, my sons, and pay attention to my words.",
      "25": "Don’t let your hearts stray away toward her. Don’t wander down her wayward path.",
