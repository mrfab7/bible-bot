    "1": {
      "1": "These are the visions that Isaiah son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem. He saw these visions during the years when Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah were kings of Judah.",
      "2": "Listen, O heavens! Pay attention, earth! This is what the Lord says: “The children I raised and cared for have rebelled against me.",
      "3": "Even an ox knows its owner, and a donkey recognizes its master’s care— but Israel doesn’t know its master. My people don’t recognize my care for them.”",
      "4": "Oh, what a sinful nation they are— loaded down with a burden of guilt. They are evil people, corrupt children who have rejected the Lord. They have despised the Holy One of Israel and turned their backs on him.",
      "5": "Why do you continue to invite punishment? Must you rebel forever? Your head is injured, and your heart is sick.",
      "6": "You are battered from head to foot— covered with bruises, welts, and infected wounds— without any soothing ointments or bandages.",
      "7": "Your country lies in ruins, and your towns are burned. Foreigners plunder your fields before your eyes and destroy everything they see.",
      "8": "Beautiful Jerusalem stands abandoned like a watchman’s shelter in a vineyard, like a lean-to in a cucumber field after the harvest, like a helpless city under siege.",
      "9": "If the Lord of Heaven’s Armies had not spared a few of us, we would have been wiped out like Sodom, destroyed like Gomorrah.",
      "10": "Listen to the Lord, you leaders of “Sodom.” Listen to the law of our God, people of “Gomorrah.”",
      "11": "“What makes you think I want all your sacrifices?” says the Lord. “I am sick of your burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fattened cattle. I get no pleasure from the blood of bulls and lambs and goats.",
      "12": "When you come to worship me, who asked you to parade through my courts with all your ceremony?",
      "13": "Stop bringing me your meaningless gifts; the incense of your offerings disgusts me! As for your celebrations of the new moon and the Sabbath and your special days for fasting— they are all sinful and false. I want no more of your pious meetings.",
      "14": "I hate your new moon celebrations and your annual festivals. They are a burden to me. I cannot stand them!",
      "15": "When you lift up your hands in prayer, I will not look. Though you offer many prayers, I will not listen, for your hands are covered with the blood of innocent victims.",
      "16": "Wash yourselves and be clean! Get your sins out of my sight. Give up your evil ways.",
      "17": "Learn to do good. Seek justice. Help the oppressed. Defend the cause of orphans. Fight for the rights of widows.",
      "18": "“Come now, let’s settle this,” says the Lord. “Though your sins are like scarlet, I will make them as white as snow. Though they are red like crimson, I will make them as white as wool.",
      "19": "If you will only obey me, you will have plenty to eat.",
      "20": "But if you turn away and refuse to listen, you will be devoured by the sword of your enemies. I, the Lord, have spoken!”",
      "21": "See how Jerusalem, once so faithful, has become a prostitute. Once the home of justice and righteousness, she is now filled with murderers.",
      "22": "Once like pure silver, you have become like worthless slag. Once so pure, you are now like watered-down wine.",
      "23": "Your leaders are rebels, the companions of thieves. All of them love bribes and demand payoffs, but they refuse to defend the cause of orphans or fight for the rights of widows.",
      "24": "Therefore, the Lord, the Lord of Heaven’s Armies, the Mighty One of Israel, says, “I will take revenge on my enemies and pay back my foes!",
      "25": "I will raise my fist against you. I will melt you down and skim off your slag. I will remove all your impurities.",
      "26": "Then I will give you good judges again and wise counselors like you used to have. Then Jerusalem will again be called the Home of Justice and the Faithful City.”",
      "27": "Zion will be restored by justice; those who repent will be revived by righteousness.",
      "28": "But rebels and sinners will be completely destroyed, and those who desert the Lord will be consumed.",
      "29": "You will be ashamed of your idol worship in groves of sacred oaks. You will blush because you worshiped in gardens dedicated to idols.",
      "30": "You will be like a great tree with withered leaves, like a garden without water.",
      "31": "The strongest among you will disappear like straw; their evil deeds will be the spark that sets it on fire. They and their evil works will burn up together, and no one will be able to put out the fire."

      "1": "This is a vision that Isaiah son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem:",
      "2": "In the last days, the mountain of the Lord’s house will be the highest of all— the most important place on earth. It will be raised above the other hills, and people from all over the world will stream there to worship.",
      "3": "People from many nations will come and say, “Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of Jacob’s God. There he will teach us his ways, and we will walk in his paths.” For the Lord’s teaching will go out from Zion; his word will go out from Jerusalem.",
      "4": "The Lord will mediate between nations and will settle international disputes. They will hammer their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will no longer fight against nation, nor train for war anymore.",
      "5": "Come, descendants of Jacob, let us walk in the light of the Lord!",
      "6": "For the Lord has rejected his people, the descendants of Jacob, because they have filled their land with practices from the East and with sorcerers, as the Philistines do. They have made alliances with pagans.",
      "7": "Israel is full of silver and gold; there is no end to its treasures. Their land is full of warhorses; there is no end to its chariots.",
      "8": "Their land is full of idols; the people worship things they have made with their own hands.",
      "9": "So now they will be humbled, and all will be brought low— do not forgive them.",
      "10": "Crawl into caves in the rocks. Hide in the dust from the terror of the Lord and the glory of his majesty.",
      "11": "Human pride will be brought down, and human arrogance will be humbled. Only the Lord will be exalted on that day of judgment.",
      "12": "For the Lord of Heaven’s Armies has a day of reckoning. He will punish the proud and mighty and bring down everything that is exalted.",
      "13": "He will cut down the tall cedars of Lebanon and all the mighty oaks of Bashan.",
      "14": "He will level all the high mountains and all the lofty hills.",
      "15": "He will break down every high tower and every fortified wall.",
      "16": "He will destroy all the great trading ships and every magnificent vessel.",
      "17": "Human pride will be humbled, and human arrogance will be brought down. Only the Lord will be exalted on that day of judgment.",
      "18": "Idols will completely disappear.",
      "19": "When the Lord rises to shake the earth, his enemies will crawl into holes in the ground. They will hide in caves in the rocks from the terror of the Lord and the glory of his majesty.",
      "20": "On that day of judgment they will abandon the gold and silver idols they made for themselves to worship. They will leave their gods to the rodents and bats,",
      "21": "while they crawl away into caverns and hide among the jagged rocks in the cliffs. They will try to escape the terror of the Lord and the glory of his majesty as he rises to shake the earth.",
      "22": "Don’t put your trust in mere humans. They are as frail as breath. What good are they?"

    "3": {
      "1": "The Lord, the Lord of Heaven’s Armies, will take away from Jerusalem and Judah everything they depend on: every bit of bread and every drop of water,",
      "2": "all their heroes and soldiers, judges and prophets, fortune-tellers and elders,",
      "3": "army officers and high officials, advisers, skilled sorcerers, and astrologers.",
      "4": "I will make boys their leaders, and toddlers their rulers.",
      "5": "People will oppress each other— man against man, neighbor against neighbor. Young people will insult their elders, and vulgar people will sneer at the honorable.",
      "6": "In those days a man will say to his brother, “Since you have a coat, you be our leader! Take charge of this heap of ruins!”",
      "7": "But he will reply, “No! I can’t help. I don’t have any extra food or clothes. Don’t put me in charge!”",
      "8": "For Jerusalem will stumble, and Judah will fall, because they speak out against the Lord and refuse to obey him. They provoke him to his face.",
      "9": "The very look on their faces gives them away. They display their sin like the people of Sodom and don’t even try to hide it. They are doomed! They have brought destruction upon themselves.",
      "10": "Tell the godly that all will be well for them. They will enjoy the rich reward they have earned!",
      "11": "But the wicked are doomed, for they will get exactly what they deserve.",
      "12": "Childish leaders oppress my people, and women rule over them. O my people, your leaders mislead you; they send you down the wrong road.",
      "13": "The Lord takes his place in court and presents his case against his people.",
      "14": "The Lord comes forward to pronounce judgment on the elders and rulers of his people: “You have ruined Israel, my vineyard. Your houses are filled with things stolen from the poor.",
      "15": "How dare you crush my people, grinding the faces of the poor into the dust?” demands the Lord, the Lord of Heaven’s Armies.",
      "16": "The Lord says, “Beautiful Zion is haughty: craning her elegant neck, flirting with her eyes, walking with dainty steps, tinkling her ankle bracelets.",
      "17": "So the Lord will send scabs on her head; the Lord will make beautiful Zion bald.”",
      "18": "On that day of judgment the Lord will strip away everything that makes her beautiful: ornaments, headbands, crescent necklaces,",
      "19": "earrings, bracelets, and veils;",
      "20": "scarves, ankle bracelets, sashes, perfumes, and charms;",

      "23": "mirrors, fine linen garments, head ornaments, and shawls.",
      "24": "Instead of smelling of sweet perfume, she will stink. She will wear a rope for a sash, and her elegant hair will fall out. She will wear rough burlap instead of rich robes. Shame will replace her beauty.",
      "25": "The men of the city will be killed with the sword, and her warriors will die in battle.",
      "26": "The gates of Zion will weep and mourn. The city will be like a ravaged woman, huddled on the ground."

    "4": {
      "1": "In that day so few men will be left that seven women will fight for each man, saying, “Let us all marry you! We will provide our own food and clothing. Only let us take your name so we won’t be mocked as old maids.”",
      "2": "But in that day, the branch of the Lord will be beautiful and glorious; the fruit of the land will be the pride and glory of all who survive in Israel.",
      "3": "All who remain in Zion will be a holy people— those who survive the destruction of Jerusalem and are recorded among the living.",
      "4": "The Lord will wash the filth from beautiful Zion and cleanse Jerusalem of its bloodstains with the hot breath of fiery judgment.",
      "5": "Then the Lord will provide shade for Mount Zion and all who assemble there. He will provide a canopy of cloud during the day and smoke and flaming fire at night, covering the glorious land.",
      "6": "It will be a shelter from daytime heat and a hiding place from storms and rain."

      "1": "Now I will sing for the one I love a song about his vineyard: My beloved had a vineyard on a rich and fertile hill.",
      "2": "He plowed the land, cleared its stones, and planted it with the best vines. In the middle he built a watchtower and carved a winepress in the nearby rocks. Then he waited for a harvest of sweet grapes, but the grapes that grew were bitter.",
      "3": "Now, you people of Jerusalem and Judah, you judge between me and my vineyard.",
      "4": "What more could I have done for my vineyard that I have not already done? When I expected sweet grapes, why did my vineyard give me bitter grapes?",
      "5": "Now let me tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will tear down its hedges and let it be destroyed. I will break down its walls and let the animals trample it.",
      "6": "I will make it a wild place where the vines are not pruned and the ground is not hoed, a place overgrown with briers and thorns. I will command the clouds to drop no rain on it.",
      "7": "The nation of Israel is the vineyard of the Lord of Heaven’s Armies. The people of Judah are his pleasant garden. He expected a crop of justice, but instead he found oppression. He expected to find righteousness, but instead he heard cries of violence.",
      "8": "What sorrow for you who buy up house after house and field after field, until everyone is evicted and you live alone in the land.",
      "9": "But I have heard the Lord of Heaven’s Armies swear a solemn oath: “Many houses will stand deserted; even beautiful mansions will be empty.",
      "10": "Ten acres of vineyard will not produce even six gallons of wine. Ten baskets of seed will yield only one basket of grain.”",
      "11": "What sorrow for those who get up early in the morning looking for a drink of alcohol and spend long evenings drinking wine to make themselves flaming drunk.",
      "12": "They furnish wine and lovely music at their grand parties— lyre and harp, tambourine and flute— but they never think about the Lord or notice what he is doing.",
      "13": "So my people will go into exile far away because they do not know me. Those who are great and honored will starve, and the common people will die of thirst.",
      "14": "The grave is licking its lips in anticipation, opening its mouth wide. The great and the lowly and all the drunken mob will be swallowed up.",
      "15": "Humanity will be destroyed, and people brought down; even the arrogant will lower their eyes in humiliation.",
      "16": "But the Lord of Heaven’s Armies will be exalted by his justice. The holiness of God will be displayed by his righteousness.",
      "17": "In that day lambs will find good pastures, and fattened sheep and young goats will feed among the ruins.",
      "18": "What sorrow for those who drag their sins behind them with ropes made of lies, who drag wickedness behind them like a cart!",
      "19": "They even mock God and say, “Hurry up and do something! We want to see what you can do. Let the Holy One of Israel carry out his plan, for we want to know what it is.”",
      "20": "What sorrow for those who say that evil is good and good is evil, that dark is light and light is dark, that bitter is sweet and sweet is bitter.",
      "21": "What sorrow for those who are wise in their own eyes and think themselves so clever.",
      "22": "What sorrow for those who are heroes at drinking wine and boast about all the alcohol they can hold.",
      "23": "They take bribes to let the wicked go free, and they punish the innocent.",
      "24": "Therefore, just as fire licks up stubble and dry grass shrivels in the flame, so their roots will rot and their flowers wither. For they have rejected the law of the Lord of Heaven’s Armies; they have despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.",
      "25": "That is why the Lord’s anger burns against his people, and why he has raised his fist to crush them. The mountains tremble, and the corpses of his people litter the streets like garbage. But even then the Lord’s anger is not satisfied. His fist is still poised to strike!",
      "26": "He will send a signal to distant nations far away and whistle to those at the ends of the earth. They will come racing toward Jerusalem.",
      "27": "They will not get tired or stumble. They will not stop for rest or sleep. Not a belt will be loose, not a sandal strap broken.",
      "28": "Their arrows will be sharp and their bows ready for battle. Sparks will fly from their horses’ hooves, and the wheels of their chariots will spin like a whirlwind.",
      "29": "They will roar like lions, like the strongest of lions. Growling, they will pounce on their victims and carry them off, and no one will be there to rescue them.",
      "30": "They will roar over their victims on that day of destruction like the roaring of the sea. If someone looks across the land, only darkness and distress will be seen; even the light will be darkened by clouds."

      "6": "Then one of the seraphim flew to me with a burning coal he had taken from the altar with a pair of tongs.",
      "7": "He touched my lips with it and said, “See, this coal has touched your lips. Now your guilt is removed, and your sins are forgiven.”",

      "12": "until the Lord has sent everyone away, and the entire land of Israel lies deserted.",
      "13": "If even a tenth—a remnant—survive, it will be invaded again and burned. But as a terebinth or oak tree leaves a stump when it is cut down, so Israel’s stump will be a holy seed.”"

      "3": "Then the Lord said to Isaiah, “Take your son Shear-jashub and go out to meet King Ahaz. You will find him at the end of the aqueduct that feeds water into the upper pool, near the road leading to the field where cloth is washed.",
      "4": "Tell him to stop worrying. Tell him he doesn’t need to fear the fierce anger of those two burned-out embers, King Rezin of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah.",

      "12": "But the king refused. “No,” he said, “I will not test the Lord like that.”",
      "13": "Then Isaiah said, “Listen well, you royal family of David! Isn’t it enough to exhaust human patience? Must you exhaust the patience of my God as well?",

      "19": "I will rejoice over Jerusalem and delight in my people. And the sound of weeping and crying will be heard in it no more.",
      "20": "“No longer will babies die when only a few days old. No longer will adults die before they have lived a full life. No longer will people be considered old at one hundred! Only the cursed will die that young!",
      "21": "In those days people will live in the houses they build and eat the fruit of their own vineyards.",
      "22": "Unlike the past, invaders will not take their houses and confiscate their vineyards. For my people will live as long as trees, and my chosen ones will have time to enjoy their hard-won gains.",
      "23": "They will not work in vain, and their children will not be doomed to misfortune. For they are people blessed by the Lord, and their children, too, will be blessed.",

      "1": "This is what the Lord says: “Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. Could you build me a temple as good as that? Could you build me such a resting place?",

      "3": "But those who choose their own ways— delighting in their detestable sins— will not have their offerings accepted. When such people sacrifice a bull, it is no more acceptable than a human sacrifice. When they sacrifice a lamb, it’s as though they had sacrificed a dog! When they bring an offering of grain, they might as well offer the blood of a pig. When they burn frankincense, it’s as if they had blessed an idol.",
      "4": "I will send them great trouble— all the things they feared. For when I called, they did not answer. When I spoke, they did not listen. They deliberately sinned before my very eyes and chose to do what they know I despise.”",
      "5": "Hear this message from the Lord, all you who tremble at his words: “Your own people hate you and throw you out for being loyal to my name. ‘Let the Lord be honored!’ they scoff. ‘Be joyful in him!’ But they will be put to shame.",

      "9": "Would I ever bring this nation to the point of birth and then not deliver it?” asks the Lord. “No! I would never keep this nation from being born,” says your God.",
      "10": "“Rejoice with Jerusalem! Be glad with her, all you who love her and all you who mourn for her.",
      "11": "Drink deeply of her glory even as an infant drinks at its mother’s comforting breasts.”",

There they will declare my glory to the nations.",
      "20": "They will bring the remnant of your people back from every nation. They will bring them to my holy mountain in Jerusalem as an offering to the Lord. They will ride on horses, in chariots and wagons, and on mules and camels,” says the Lord.",
      "21": "“And I will appoint some of them to be my priests and Levites. I, the Lord, have spoken!",
      "22": "“As surely as my new heavens and earth will remain, so will you always be my people, with a name that will never disappear,” says the Lord.",
      "23": "“All humanity will come to worship me from week to week and from month to month.",
