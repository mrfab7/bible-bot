      "1": "The proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:",
      "2": "To learn wisdom and moral instruction, to discern wise counsel.",
      "3": "To receive moral instruction in skillful living, with righteousness, justice, and equity.",
      "4": "To impart shrewdness to the morally naive, a discerning plan to the young person.",
      "5": "(Let the wise also hear and gain instruction, and let the discerning acquire guidance!)",
      "6": "To discern the meaning of a proverb and a parable, the sayings of the wise and their riddles.",
      "7": "Fearing the Lord is the beginning of discernment, but fools have despised wisdom and moral instruction.",
      "8": "Listen, my child, to the instruction from your father, and do not forsake the teaching from your mother.",
      "9": "For they will be like an elegant garland on your head, and like pendants around your neck.",
      "10": "My child, if sinners try to entice you, do not consent!",
      "11": "If they say, “Come with us! We will lie in wait to shed blood; we will ambush an innocent person capriciously.",
      "12": "We will swallow them alive like Sheol, those full of vigor like those going down to the Pit.",
      "13": "We will seize all kinds of precious wealth; we will fill our houses with plunder.",
      "14": "Join with us! We will all share equally in what we steal.”",
      "15": "My child, do not go down their way, withhold yourself from their path;",
      "16": "for they are eager to inflict harm, and they hasten to shed blood.",
      "17": "Surely it is futile to spread a net in plain sight of any bird,",
      "18": "but these men lie in wait for their own blood, they ambush their own lives!",
      "19": "Such are the ways of all who gain profit unjustly; it takes away the life of those who obtain it!",
      "20": "Wisdom calls out in the street, she shouts loudly in the plazas;",
      "21": "at the head of the noisy streets she calls, in the entrances of the gates in the city she utters her words:",
      "22": "“How long will you simpletons love naiveté? How long have mockers delighted in mockery? And how long will fools hate knowledge?",
      "23": "You should respond to my rebuke. Then I would pour out my thoughts to you; I would make my words known to you.",
      "24": "However, because I called but you refused to listen, because I stretched out my hand but no one was paying attention,",
      "25": "and you neglected all my advice, and did not comply with my rebuke,",
      "26": "so I myself will laugh when disaster strikes you, I will mock when what you dread comes,",
      "27": "when what you dread comes like a whirlwind, and disaster strikes you like a devastating storm, when distressing trouble comes on you.",
      "28": "Then they will call to me, but I will not answer; they will diligently seek me, but they will not find me.",
      "29": "Because they hated moral knowledge, and did not choose to fear the Lord,",
      "30": "they did not comply with my advice, they spurned all my rebuke.",
      "31": "Therefore they will eat from the fruit of their way, and they will be stuffed full of their own counsel.",
      "32": "For the waywardness of the simpletons will kill them, and the careless ease of fools will destroy them.",
      "33": "But the one who listens to me will live in security, and will be at ease from the dread of harm.”"

      "17": "who leaves the husband from her younger days, and has ignored her marriage covenant made before God.",
      "18": "For she has set her house by death, and her paths by the place of the departed spirits.",
      "19": "None who go in to her will return, nor will they reach the paths of life.",
      "20": "So you will walk in the way of good people, and will keep on the paths of the righteous.",

      "11": "My child, do not despise discipline from the Lord, and do not loathe his rebuke.",
      "12": "For the Lord disciplines those he loves, just as a father disciplines the son in whom he delights.",
      "13": "Blessed is the one who has found wisdom, and the one who obtains understanding.",
      "14": "For her benefit is more profitable than silver, and her gain is better than gold.",
      "15": "She is more precious than rubies, and none of the things you desire can compare with her.",
      "16": "Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor.",
      "17": "Her ways are very pleasant, and all her paths are peaceful.",
      "18": "She is like a tree of life to those who grasp onto her, and everyone who takes hold of her will be blessed.",
      "19": "By wisdom the Lord laid the foundation of the earth; he established the heavens by understanding.",
      "20": "By his knowledge the primordial sea was broken open, so that the clouds drip down dew.",
      "21": "My child, do not let them escape from your sight; safeguard sound wisdom and discretion.",
      "22": "So they will become life for your soul, and grace around your neck.",
      "23": "Then you will walk on your way with security, and you will not stumble.",
      "24": "When you lie down you will not be filled with fear; when you lie down your sleep will be pleasant.",

      "30": "Do not accuse anyone without legitimate cause, if he has not treated you wrongly.",
      "31": "Do not envy a violent man, and do not choose any of his ways;",
      "32": "for one who goes astray is an abomination to the Lord, but he reveals his intimate counsel to the upright.",
      "33": "The Lord’s curse is on the household of the wicked, but he blesses the home of the righteous.",
      "34": "With arrogant scoffers he is scornful, yet he shows favor to the humble.",

      "20": "But why should you be captivated, my son, by an adulteress, and embrace the bosom of a different woman?",
