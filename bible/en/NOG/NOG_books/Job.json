  "Job": {
    "1": {
      "1": "A man named Job lived in Uz. He was a man of integrity: He was decent, he feared Elohim, and he stayed away from evil.",
      "2": "He had seven sons and three daughters.",
      "3": "He owned 7,000 sheep and goats, 3,000 camels, 1,000 oxen, 500 donkeys, and a large number of servants. He was the most influential person in the Middle East.",
      "4": "His sons used to go to each other’s homes, where they would have parties. (Each brother took his turn having a party.) They would send someone to invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.",
      "5": "When they finished having their parties, Job would send for them in order to cleanse them from sin. He would get up early in the morning and sacrifice burnt offerings for each of them. Job thought, “My children may have sinned and cursed Elohim in their hearts.” Job offered sacrifices for them all the time.",
      "6": "One day when the sons of Elohim came to stand in front of Yahweh, Satan the Accuser came along with them.",
      "7": "Yahweh asked Satan, “Where have you come from?” Satan answered Yahweh, “From wandering all over the earth.”",
      "8": "Yahweh asked Satan, “Have you thought about my servant Job? No one in the world is like him! He is a man of integrity: He is decent, he fears Elohim, and he stays away from evil.”",
      "9": "Satan answered Yahweh, “Haven’t you given Job a reason to fear Elohim?",
      "10": "Haven’t you put a protective fence around him, his home, and everything he has? You have blessed everything he does. His cattle have spread out over the land.",
      "11": "But now stretch out your hand, and strike everything he has. I bet he’ll curse you to your face.”",
      "12": "Yahweh told Satan, “Everything he has is in your power, but you must not lay a hand on him!” Then Satan left Yahweh’s presence.",
      "13": "One day when Job’s sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s home,",
      "14": "a messenger came to Job. He said, “While the oxen were plowing and the donkeys were grazing nearby,",
      "15": "men from Sheba attacked. They took the livestock and massacred the servants. I’m the only one who has escaped to tell you.”",
      "16": "While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, “A fire from Elohim fell from heaven and completely burned your flocks and servants. I’m the only one who has escaped to tell you.”",
      "17": "While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, “The Chaldeans formed three companies and made a raid on the camels. They took the camels and massacred the servants. I’m the only one who has escaped to tell you.”",
      "18": "While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, “Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine at their oldest brother’s home",
      "19": "when suddenly a great storm swept across the desert and struck the four corners of the house. It fell on the young people, and they died. I’m the only one who has escaped to tell you.”",
      "20": "Job stood up, tore his robe in grief, and shaved his head. Then he fell to the ground and worshiped.",
      "21": "He said, “Naked I came from my mother, and naked I will return. Yahweh has given, and Yahweh has taken away! May the name of Yahweh be praised.”",
      "22": "Through all this Job did not sin or blame Elohim for doing anything wrong."
    },
    "2": {
      "1": "One day when the sons of Elohim came to stand in front of Yahweh, Satan the Accuser came along with them.",
      "2": "Yahweh asked Satan, “Where have you come from?” Satan answered Yahweh, “From wandering all over the earth.”",
      "3": "Yahweh asked Satan, “Have you thought about my servant Job? No one in the world is like him! He is a man of integrity: He is decent, he fears Elohim, and he stays away from evil. And he still holds on to his principles. You’re trying to provoke me into ruining him for no reason.”",
      "4": "Satan answered Yahweh, “Skin for skin! Certainly, a man will give everything he has for his life.",
      "5": "But stretch out your hand, and strike his flesh and bones. I bet he’ll curse you to your face.”",
      "6": "Yahweh told Satan, “He is in your power, but you must spare his life!”",
      "7": "Satan left Yahweh’s presence and struck Job with painful boils from the soles of his feet to the top of his head.",
      "8": "Job took a piece of broken pottery to scratch himself as he sat in the ashes.",
      "9": "His wife asked him, “Are you still holding on to your principles? Curse Elohim and die!”",
      "10": "He said to her, “You’re talking like a godless fool. We accept the good that Elohim gives us. Shouldn’t we also accept the bad?” Through all this Job’s lips did not utter one sinful word.",
      "11": "When Job’s three friends heard about all the terrible things that had happened to him, each of them came from his home—Eliphaz of Teman, Bildad of Shuah, Zophar of Naama. They had agreed they would go together to sympathize with Job and comfort him.",
      "12": "When they saw him from a distance, they didn’t even recognize him. They cried out loud and wept, and each of them tore his own clothes in grief. They threw dust on their heads.",
      "13": "Then they sat down on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights. No one said a word to him because they saw that he was in such great pain."
    },
    "3": {
      "1": "After all this, Job finally opened his mouth and cursed the day he was born.",
      "2": "Job said,",
      "3": "“Scratch out the day I was born and the night that said, ‘A boy has been conceived!’",
      "4": "“That day— let it be pitch-black. Let Eloah above not even care about it. Let no light shine on it.",
      "5": "Let the darkness and long shadows claim it as their own. Let a dark cloud hang over it. Let the gloom terrify it.",
      "6": "“That night— let the blackness take it away. Let it not be included in the days of the year or be numbered among the months.",
      "7": "Let that night be empty. Let no joyful singing be heard in it.",
      "8": "Let those who curse the day (those who know how to wake up Leviathan) curse that night.",
      "9": "Let its stars turn dark before dawn. Let it hope for light and receive none. Let it not see the first light of dawn",
      "10": "because it did not shut the doors of the womb from which I came or hide my eyes from trouble.",
      "11": "“Why didn’t I die as soon as I was born and breathe my last breath when I came out of the womb?",
      "12": "Why did knees welcome me? Why did breasts let me nurse?",
      "13": "Instead of being alive, I would now be quietly lying down. I would now be sleeping peacefully.",
      "14": "I would be with the kings and the counselors of the world who built for themselves what are now ruins.",
      "15": "I would be with princes who had gold, who filled their homes with silver.",
      "16": "I would be buried like a stillborn baby. I would not exist. I would be like infants who never saw the light.",
      "17": "There the wicked stop their raging. There the weary are able to rest.",
      "18": "There the captives have no troubles at all. There they do not hear the shouting of the slave driver.",
      "19": "There you find both the unimportant and important people. There the slave is free from his master.",
      "20": "“Why give light to one in misery and life to those who find it so bitter,",
      "21": "to those who long for death but it never comes— though they dig for it more than for buried treasure?",
      "22": "They are ecstatic, delighted to find the grave.",
      "23": "Why give light to those whose paths have been hidden, to those whom Eloah has fenced in?",
      "24": "“When my food is in front of me, I sigh. I pour out my groaning like water.",
      "25": "What I fear most overtakes me. What I dread happens to me.",
      "26": "I have no peace! I have no quiet! I have no rest! And trouble keeps coming!”"
    },
    "4": {
      "1": "Then Eliphaz from Teman replied to Job,",
      "2": "“If someone tries to talk to you, will you become impatient? But who can keep from talking?",
      "3": "Certainly, you have instructed many people: When hands were weak, you made them strong.",
      "4": "When someone stumbled, you lifted him up with your words. When knees were weak, you gave them strength.",
      "5": "But trouble comes to you, and you’re impatient. It touches you, and you panic.",
      "6": "Doesn’t your fear of Elohim give you confidence and your lifetime of integrity give you hope?",
      "7": "“Now think about this: Which innocent person ever died an untimely death? Find me a decent person who has been destroyed.",
      "8": "Whenever I saw those who plowed wickedness and planted misery, they gathered its harvest.",
      "9": "Eloah destroys them with his breath and kills them with a blast of his anger.",
      "10": "Though the roar of the lion and the growl of the ferocious lion is loud, the young lions have had their teeth knocked out.",
      "11": "The old lions die without any prey to eat, and the cubs of the lioness are scattered.",
      "12": "“I was told something secretly and heard something whispered in my ear.",
      "13": "With disturbing thoughts from visions in the night, when deep sleep falls on people,",
      "14": "fear and trembling came over me, and all my bones shook.",
      "15": "A spirit passed in front of me. It made my hair stand on end.",
      "16": "Something stood there. I couldn’t tell what it was. A vague image was in front of my eyes. I heard a soft voice:",
      "17": "‘Can any mortal be righteous to Eloah? Can any human being be pure to his maker?’",
      "18": "“You see, Eloah doesn’t trust his own servants, and he accuses his angels of making mistakes.",
      "19": "How much more will he accuse those who live in clay houses that have their foundation in the dust. Those houses can be crushed quicker than a moth!",
      "20": "From morning to evening, they are shattered. They will disappear forever without anyone paying attention.",
      "21": "Haven’t the ropes of their tent been loosened? Won’t they die without wisdom?"
    },
    "5": {
      "1": "“Cry out! Is there anyone to answer you? To which of the holy ones will you turn?",
      "2": "Certainly, anger kills a stubborn fool, and jealousy murders a gullible person.",
      "3": "I have seen a stubborn fool take root, but I quickly cursed his house.",
      "4": "His children are far from help. They are crushed at the city gate, and no one is there to rescue them.",
      "5": "What a stubborn fool gathers, hungry people eat. They take it even from among the thorns, and thirsty people pant after his wealth.",
      "6": "Certainly, sorrow doesn’t come from the soil, and trouble doesn’t sprout from the ground.",
      "7": "But a person is born for trouble as surely as sparks fly up from a fire.",
      "8": "“But I would seek El’s help and present my case to Elohim.",
      "9": "He does great things that we cannot understand and miracles that we cannot count.",
      "10": "He gives rain to the earth and sends water to the fields.",
      "11": "He places lowly people up high. He lifts those who mourn to safety.",
      "12": "He keeps shrewd people from carrying out their plans so that they cannot do anything successfully.",
      "13": "He catches the wise with their own tricks. The plans of schemers prove to be hasty.",
      "14": "In the daytime they meet darkness and grope in the sunlight as if it were night.",
      "15": "“But he saves other people from their slander and the needy from the power of the mighty.",
      "16": "Then the poor have hope while wrongdoing shuts its mouth.",
      "17": "“Blessed is the person whom Eloah corrects. That person should not despise discipline from Shadday.",
      "18": "God injures, but he bandages. He beats you up, but his hands make you well.",
      "19": "He will keep you safe from six troubles, and when the seventh one comes, no harm will touch you:",
      "20": "“In famine he will save you from death, and in war he will save you from the sword.",
      "21": "“When the tongue lashes out, you will be safe, and you will not be afraid of destruction when it comes.",
      "22": "“You will be able to laugh at destruction and starvation, so do not be afraid of wild animals on the earth.",
      "23": "“You will have a binding agreement with the stones in the field, and wild animals will be at peace with you.",
      "24": "“You will know peace in your tent. You will inspect your house and find nothing missing.",
      "25": "“You will find that your children are many and your descendants are like the grass of the earth.",
      "26": "“You will come to your grave at a ripe old age like a stack of hay in the right season.",
      "27": "“We have studied all of this thoroughly! This is the way it is. Listen to it, and learn it for yourself.”"
    },
    "6": {
      "1": "Then Job replied to his friends,",
      "2": "“If only my grief could be weighed, if only my misery could be laid on the scales with it,",
      "3": "then they would be heavier than the sand of the seas. I spoke carelessly",
      "4": "because the arrows of Shadday have found their target in me, and my spirit is drinking their poison. Eloah’s terrors line up in battle against me.",
      "5": "“Does a wild donkey bray when it’s eating grass, or does an ox make a sound over its hay?",
      "6": "Is tasteless food eaten without salt, or is there any flavor in the white of an egg?",
      "7": "I refuse to touch such things. They are disgusting to me.",
      "8": "“How I wish that my prayer would be answered— that Eloah would give me what I’m hoping for,",
      "9": "that Eloah would finally be willing to crush me, that he would reach out to cut me off.",
      "10": "Then I would still have comfort. I would be happy despite my endless pain, because I have not rejected the words of the Holy One.",
      "11": "What strength do I have left that I can go on hoping? What goal do I have that I would want to prolong my life?",
      "12": "Do I have the strength of rocks? Does my body have the strength of bronze?",
      "13": "Am I not completely helpless? Haven’t my skills been taken away from me?",
      "14": "“A friend should treat a troubled person kindly, even if he abandons the fear of Shadday.",
      "15": "My brothers have been as deceptive as seasonal rivers, like the seasonal riverbeds that flood.",
      "16": "They are dark with ice. They are hidden by snow.",
      "17": "They vanish during a scorching summer. In the heat their riverbeds dry up.",
      "18": "They change their course. They go into a wasteland and disappear.",
      "19": "Caravans from Tema look for them. Travelers from Sheba search for them.",
      "20": "They are ashamed because they relied on the streams. Arriving there, they are disappointed.",
      "21": "“So you are as unreliable to me as they are. You see something terrifying, and you are afraid.",
      "22": "Did I ever say, ‘Give me a gift,’ or ‘Offer me a bribe from your wealth,’",
      "23": "or ‘Rescue me from an enemy,’ or ‘Ransom me from a tyrant’?",
      "24": "Teach me, and I’ll be silent. Show me where I’ve been wrong.",
      "25": "How painful an honest discussion can be! In correcting me, you correct yourselves!",
      "26": "Do you think my words need correction? Do you think they’re what a desperate person says to the wind?",
      "27": "Would you also throw dice for an orphan? Would you buy and sell your friend?",
      "28": "“But now, if you’re willing, look at me. I won’t lie to your face.",
      "29": "Please change your mind. Don’t permit any injustice. Change your mind because I am still right about this!",
      "30": "Is there injustice on my tongue, or is my mouth unable to tell the difference between right and wrong?"
    },
    "7": {
      "1": "“Isn’t a mortal’s stay on earth difficult like a hired hand’s daily work?",
      "2": "Like a slave, he longs for shade. Like a hired hand, he eagerly looks for his pay.",
      "3": "Likewise, I have been given months that are of no use, and I have inherited nights filled with misery.",
      "4": "When I lie down, I ask, ‘When will I get up?’ But the evening is long, and I’m exhausted from tossing about until dawn.",
      "5": "My body is covered with maggots and scabs. My skin is crusted over with sores; then they ooze.",
      "6": "My days go swifter than a weaver’s shuttle. They are spent without hope.",
      "7": "Remember, my life is only a breath, and never again will my eyes see anything good.",
      "8": "The eye that watches over me will no longer see me. Your eye will look for me, but I’ll be gone.",
      "9": "As a cloud fades away and disappears, so a person goes into the grave and doesn’t come back again.",
      "10": "He doesn’t come back home again, and his household doesn’t recognize him anymore.",
      "11": "So I won’t keep my mouth shut, but I will speak from the distress that is in my spirit and complain about the bitterness in my soul.",
      "12": "“Am I the sea or a sea monster that you have set a guard over me?",
      "13": "When I say, ‘My couch may give me comfort. My bed may help me bear my pain,’",
      "14": "then you frighten me with dreams and terrify me with visions.",
      "15": "My throat would rather be choked. My body would prefer death to these dreams.",
      "16": "I hate my life; I do not want to live forever. Leave me alone because my days are so brief.",
      "17": "“What is a mortal that you should make so much of him, that you should be concerned about him?",
      "18": "What is he that you should inspect him every morning and examine him every moment?",
      "19": "Why don’t you stop looking at me long enough to let me swallow my spit?",
      "20": "If I sin, what can I possibly do to you since you insist on spying on people? Why do you make me your target? I’ve become a burden even to myself.",
      "21": "Why don’t you forgive my disobedience and take away my sin? Soon I’ll lie down in the dust. Then you will search for me, but I’ll be gone!”"
    },
    "8": {
      "1": "Then Bildad from Shuah replied to Job,",
      "2": "“How long will you say these things? How long will your words be so windy?",
      "3": "Does El distort justice, or does Shadday distort righteousness?",
      "4": "If your children sinned against him, he allowed them to suffer the consequences of their sinfulness.",
      "5": "If you search for El and plead for mercy from Shadday,",
      "6": "if you are moral and ethical, then he will rise up on your behalf and prove your righteousness by rebuilding your home.",
      "7": "Then what you had in the past will seem small compared with the great prosperity you’ll have in the future.",
      "8": "“Ask the people of past generations. Find out what their ancestors had learned.",
      "9": "We have only been around since yesterday, and we know nothing. Our days on earth are only a fleeting shadow.",
      "10": "Won’t their words teach you? Won’t they share their thoughts with you?",
      "11": "“Can papyrus grow up where there is no swamp? Can rushes grow tall without water?",
      "12": "Even if they were fresh and not cut, they would wither quicker than grass.",
      "13": "The same thing happens to all who forget El. The hope of the godless dies.",
      "14": "His confidence is easily shattered. His trust is a spider’s web.",
      "15": "If one leans on his house, it collapses. If one holds on to it, it will not support his weight.",
      "16": "He is like a well-watered plant in the sunshine. The shoots spread over his garden.",
      "17": "Its roots weave through a pile of stones. They cling to a stone house.",
      "18": "But when it is uprooted from its place, the ground denies it and says, ‘I never saw you!’",
      "19": "That is its joy in this life, and others sprout from the same ground to take its place.",
      "20": "“Certainly, El does not reject a person of integrity or give a helping hand to wicked people.",
      "21": "He will fill your mouth with laughter and your lips with happy shouting.",
      "22": "Those who hate you will be clothed with shame, and the tent of the wicked will cease to exist.”"
    },
    "9": {
      "1": "Then Job replied to his friends,",
      "2": "“Yes, I know that this is true. But how can a mortal be declared righteous to El?",
      "3": "If he wished to debate with El, he wouldn’t be able to answer one question in a thousand.",
      "4": "“El is wise in heart and mighty in power. Who could oppose him and win?",
      "5": "He moves mountains without their knowing it, and he topples them in his anger.",
      "6": "He shakes the earth from its place, and its pillars tremble.",
      "7": "He commands the sun not to rise. He doesn’t let the stars come out.",
      "8": "He stretches out the heavens by himself and walks on the waves of the sea.",
      "9": "He made the constellations Ursa Major, Orion, and the Pleiades, and the clusters of stars in the south.",
      "10": "He does great things that are unsearchable and miracles that cannot be numbered.",
      "11": "He passes alongside of me, and I don’t even see him. He goes past me, and I don’t even notice him.",
      "12": "He takes something away, but who can stop him? Who is going to ask him, ‘What are you doing?’",
      "13": "Eloah does not hold back his anger. Even Rahab’s helpers bow humbly in front of him.",
      "14": "“How can I possibly answer Eloah? How can I find the right words to speak with him?",
      "15": "Even if I were right, I could not answer him. I would have to plead for mercy from my judge.",
      "16": "If I cried out and he answered me, I do not believe that he would listen to me.",
      "17": "He would knock me down with a storm and bruise me without a reason.",
      "18": "He would not let me catch my breath. He fills me with bitterness.",
      "19": "If it is a matter of strength, then he is the mighty one. If it is about justice, who will charge me with a crime?",
      "20": "If I am righteous, my own mouth would condemn me. It would declare that I am corrupt even if I am a man of integrity.",
      "21": "If I am a man of integrity, I have no way of knowing it. I hate my life!",
      "22": "It is all the same. That is why I say, ‘He destroys both the man of integrity and the wicked.’",
      "23": "When a sudden disaster brings death, he makes fun of the despair of innocent people.",
      "24": "The earth is handed over to the wicked. He covers the faces of its judges. If he isn’t the one doing this, who is?",
      "25": "“My days go by more quickly than a runner. They sprint away. They don’t see anything good.",
      "26": "They pass by quickly like boats made from reeds, like an eagle swooping down on its prey.",
      "27": "Even if I say, ‘I will forget my complaining; I will change my expression and smile,’",
      "28": "I still dread everything I must suffer. I know that you won’t declare me innocent.",
      "29": "I’ve already been found guilty. Why should I work so hard for nothing?",
      "30": "If I wash myself with lye soap and cleanse my hands with bleach,",
      "31": "then you would plunge me into a muddy pit, and my own clothes would find me disgusting.",
      "32": "A human like me cannot answer Eloah, ‘Let’s take our case to court.’",
      "33": "There is no mediator between us to put his hand on both of us.",
      "34": "Eloah should take his rod away from me, and he should not terrify me.",

      "1": "“I hate my life. I will freely express my complaint. I will speak as bitterly as I feel.",
      "2": "I will say to Eloah, ‘Don’t condemn me. Let me know why you are quarreling with me.",
      "3": "What do you gain by mistreating me, by rejecting the work of your hands while you favor the plans of the wicked?",
      "4": "Do you actually have human eyes? Do you see as a mortal sees?",
      "5": "Are your days like a mortal’s days? Are your years like a human’s years?",
      "6": "Is that why you look for guilt in me and search for sin in me?",
      "7": "You know I’m not guilty, but there is no one to rescue me from your hands.",
      "8": "“‘Your hands formed me and made every part of me, then you turned to destroy me.",

      "12": "You gave me life and mercy. Your watchfulness has preserved my spirit.",
      "13": "But in your heart you hid these things. I know this is what you did.",
      "14": "“‘If I sin, you watch me and will not free me from my guilt.",

      "16": "Like a proud, ferocious lion you hunt me down. You keep working your miracles against me.",
      "17": "You keep finding new witnesses against me. You keep increasing your anger toward me. You keep bringing new armies against me.",
