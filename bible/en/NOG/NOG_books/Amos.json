      "6": "I left you with nothing to eat in any of your cities. I left you with no food in your entire land. And you still didn’t return to me, declares Yahweh.",
      "7": "I stopped the rain from falling three months before the harvest. I sent rain on one city and not on another. One field had rain. Another field had none and dried up.",

      "9": "I struck your crops with blight and mildew. Locusts repeatedly devoured your gardens, vineyards, fig trees, and olive trees. And you still didn’t return to me, declares Yahweh.",
      "10": "I sent plagues on you as I did to Egypt. With swords I killed your best young men along with your captured horses. I made the stench from your camps fill your noses. And you still didn’t return to me, declares Yahweh.",
      "11": "I destroyed some of you as Elohim destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah. You were like a burning log snatched from a fire. And you still didn’t return to me, declares Yahweh.",

      "12": "I know that your crimes are numerous and your sins are many. You oppress the righteous by taking bribes. You deny the needy access to the courts.",
      "13": "That is why a wise person remains silent at such times, because those times are so evil.",
      "14": "Search for good instead of evil so that you may live. Then Yahweh Elohe Tsebaoth will be with you, as you have said.",
      "15": "Hate evil and love good. Then you will be able to have justice in your courts. Maybe Yahweh Elohe Tsebaoth will have pity on the faithful few of Joseph.",
